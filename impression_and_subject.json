  "I think this is an eyeball iris macro... but I could be wrong.  It has an other-worldly appearance.  It appears to be cropped heavily from the original, and when that happens, along with resizing, you lose a lot of quality and resolution.  The centering of the subject makes for a rather flat image; perhaps choosing a composition where the pupil is in the top left or top right corner, with the colors of the iris coming out from it in diagonals would make it a bit more dynamic.  The lights reflected in the pupil are distracting, which pulls the attention away from the rest of the image.  I think you were on the right track with the idea, but the lack of technical and creative proficiency in the idea's execution will probably have you falling short of a score you might hope to achieve.  It is not something most voters would hang on their walls.  I wish you luck in future challenges...don't give up!! :)"

The challenge would indicate that your circle was the main subject, but the circle just kind of acts as a frame, rather than main subject.  You had a really beautiful sky for taking pics.  I do like the idea of framing something with this hole, but would think that whatever it was framing would be the main subject (as you thought too, by your title).  Focus appears good.

I don't know if you thought you were just going to test the theory that people would vote down a technically good photo based on subject matter, but I hope your experiment works.

In this case, there are 3 somethings to look at so it sort of splits the attention.  The color is kinda cool...  I've never seen a leaf that color before and so, as images go, it's fairly interesting.  But as for the \"macro challenge\" I could only call it average.

I'm seeing that a LOT and most of the time it just doesn't work.  Hard to tell what this is.  A bottle maybe?  The purple center doesn't appear to be in focus, nor does anything else in the photo, so it's all kind of a blurred circular thingy.  I'm not a huge fan of abstracts, and this is no exception.  Some will love it, but it's just not my cup of tea.  I think a black border with a thin colored (red?) line would work here as well.  ~Heather~"

I realize that you were shooting for the center to be the 'main subject' but it just doesn't come across that way to me.  The lighting is harsh.  Reflections in the CD are very distracting and the large white reflection at the top is blown out/white.  The center circle doesn't appears to be not in the center of the CD, making this look like a quick kind of shot.  The centered composition isn't very visually appealing and the greyish kind of background doesn't really acentuate the subject very well.  I hope this doesn't come across as too harsh, but in the same respect, I hope it helps you out in your further photography.  ~Heather~"

I'm not really sure that the 'main subject is clearly a circle', but it is definately implied, and that's good for something.  One thing I don't like is how the rope is leaving the photo out the left side.  This seems awkward to me.  Seems like it should be leaving the photo out the top.  That may also help bring a bit of balance to the shot.  Right now, it's left side heavy.  Looks like you have a dead pixel direcly above the nose.  Not like that affects your score any, just an observation in case you didn't know.  You can clone it out in advanced challenges, but not in basic, so probably doesn't matter much anyway.  ~Heather~"

As for the photo, I think greater DOF that would reveal the reflection off the inside of the ring toward the top of the photo might have given it more interest. As it is, the emphasis seems to be on the words, not the ring. If so, the secondary element obscures the primary. If the subject is intended to be the ring, I'd give it more emphasis with stronger focus. Just my opinion. Feel free to disregard."

It's very interesting that, often times in an image like this, you think, what a great scene, I wish there was a person, or some kind of subject there, but in this photo, I find that it has a strong subject that is not actually there. What I mean is, I keep leaning in my chair to the left trying really hard to get a peek at what is just beyond that turn. I find this very cool and stimulating, it really helps draw me into the photo.  My only nitpick with it is, the path looks just slightly blown out, it looks like there is some neat texture there. Perhaps in your editing, you could try using the burn tool over it with the opacity of the layer reduced, this may bring out a lot of extra detail. Good job."

Super....my only possible nit is that the bit of white fencing to the right of the bridge just seems out of place but it is as found so I'll let it go. Good luck!"

I think that's what is causing the noise in the sky too. Depending on what format you shot this with, the original could be sharpened at approx. 125%, 0.5 to 1.0 Radius (0.5 for JPG, 1.0 uncompressed TIF), 0 Threshold as a good starting point.  Then the re-sized version could be re-sharpened using approx. half the Radius.  Hope this is helpful.",

  "As is, the image is more a recording of a factual item but the clutter of different textures takes away from the intent. I would have certainly considered a closer take showing the base of the chimney. You see, we find a subject and for some reason we feel we must make a recording and this is fine, but when we enter a challenge, we want the image to be more impressive. We think that if we go closer it will not tell the whole story. This is true, but the object is to display a unique view. However, this is not so easily accomplished. For example, is there any hint on any of the sides of the base that still retains the frame of the actual burning pit. On short is there anything else of interest that could have allowed a closer image of about 6 feet of the base? I am sure you did your homework and therefore this is the best that can be done as is.",

With your subject filling the frame more, it will also solve the dead center 'snapshot' look of the photograph.",

  "In my opinon the subject lacks interest and the title should have read \"Size DOES Matter\".  This way it would have made more of a statement.  As for the photo the screen of the LCD looks either dirty or the overhead lights are playing havoc on the screen itself and projecting a glare.  I also would have positioned the screen a little to the left to get rid of the distracting background (shelf perhaps?).  However it did fit the challenge very well and has a very nice choice in DOF."

IMO this would have been better if the subject wasn't so brightly exposed and the background so darkly exposed. There are some blown highlights on the edge of the plate that distract somewhat. I might have chosen a different placemat, or possibly used a wood table. The centered composition is only partially rescued by the single chopstick (?)

Taking this shot slightly closer to the anchor so that it's set against the water and the mountain would help give it more impact, but you also have to watch where the eye is lead in that case: the anchor should remain the subject."

The element of the tractor is a great linking tool.  I probably would have cut cropped this to diminish the hunched over posture. I would bring the right border to about where the long vertical fold in his shirt is located. This slims the subject and also gives him more room forward than behind, symbolizing the future.

Basically a high contrast image. Adding some red light would then make it almost demonic and outside of what we normally see. You get a six for the good effort as is.",

For me the response reiterates my question; if someone feels they should add to the already high number of holes in the human body, why would it be inside the mouth and especially on the tongue? No one can see it and it MUST interfere with at least four normally unencumbered processes.

The yellow light box that obscures a part of the crane, the light fixtures on the right side, etc. The striped, sloped tent makes a nice counter point to the angling of the crane, but the stripes don't quite work.

I has beautiful blues and it is a very crisp photo I find the photo itself lacks interest/subject.  Perhaps a tighter crop would have made for a better photo, for example if you cropped up the bottom stair (about where you see the 5 blue marks on the plywood) and centered the crop (crop some off the right side)  would have made for a more appealing photo.  All and all I tink its the subject itself that I personally find unappealing.  It also appears that the camera was on a bit of an angle giving it an odd depth on the right side of this photo.  However I do realy like the blue sky in the background and love the way you have captured the cloud within the frame of the house.  Good luck in this challenge.  <5>"

It's hard to tell if the horizon in the distant background is actually level, but the structure itself, and especially the ledge in the foreground are tilted. This could be corrected with arbitrary rotation in ps. I'm also thinking that maybe if the ledge were actually cropped out, or maybe at least to the ledge itself, removing the 'rock wall' portion in the bottom of the frame it could make the shot stronger, as to me, it seems to just be a distraction to your main subject."

I find the photo has to much contrast from the sky and giving the building a fuzzy/soft focus look which I find unnecessary and very distracting.  I also find that you may have a clarity issue with the tree leaves which may or may not be corrected by a slight levels adjustment or color adjustment.  However dispite my personal views on the building I find that this could have made for a nicer shot(for this particular building) if the sky was blue or stormy grey and a little more focused.

There is nothing there - no reflections, no points of light making it feel somehow unnatural or as if there is something missing perhaps. (I\uff0am wondering if you softened the pupil in post processing as it seems much softer than the rest of the image?) This in turn gives the impression that the subject is bored, tired or at least expressionless.

The lighting adds an ominous tone to the whole and the model's expression is perfect for the concept.  This is an image that requires pop-culture knowledge, but does not scream suicide like others, instead it forces the subject into an active thought process which is something that most submissions in this challenge neglected to fully communicate.

Remember, what you know of your subject, and what the rest of us know is worlds apart.  Its like writing poetry.

Were this a human subject with an expression like this one would be forced to agree that the person was deep in thought, potentially making a hard decision.  For the expression alone then, I grant a solid link to the challenge request.",

I then look to my benchmark images and consider that this image rates right up there with them, it is not a benchmark image for me, but compared to those benchmarks it's quality and finesse deserves a 10.

I found the detail in the dresser to be lost mostly in shadows, though now that I know what I am looking at, can see it all clearly.  The side lighting has hurt you by dropping shadows in all the worst places.  This image needs a fill flash on the opposite side to bring more definition to the background and potentially give a solid separation to the underwear and robe.  The redemption of the image is the look on his face.  Had the model not been as expressive I surely would have overlooked the decision and passed by the objects of his decision as unfortunate clutter in the image.  Bumping to a 5 on challenge and technicals."

Instead of having a bright light, taking away any shadows that might have been on him, you could use more selective lighting. Light side or dark, it's something dramatic, give it some dramatic lighting! Also, I find the shadow of Vader's mask doesn't help, since Yoda doesn't have one. Nice try though, good idea for sure!"

The other subject would not have been enough in that case though, they would have to be showing joy (\"accepting\") or pushing the ring away (\"declining\") to show that a decision by one party had been made.

As an image the capture is nice and sharp on the subject but the dof has had the unfortunate effect of making the left side seem way overexposed.

It is not an image that I would hang on my wall, however I am certain that there is an audience for just this type of image.  It seems well placed in the whole but I am drawn to wonder if a narrower crop where less of the stem is revealed would make it more interesting a capture.

The angle of view and placement of the main subject is hurt more by the placement of the branches.  I cannot see the look on the kitten's face, the fear or thought that might be washing over it determining its fate to remain perched or fall.  I find that the blurred fore branches contrasted with the one very well defined branch in the back right create a chaos, but does not invoke a decision for me.  There is nice color in the leaves behind the cat, but even they are more well defined that the main subject's fur.  I must offer a 2 on this image.  It comes off to me as chaotic with neither a well defined subject or solid connection to the challenge."

It is a perfect 'Sports Illustrated' image with a dof that highlights the main subject exclusively while still putting him in the setting he is supposed to be in.

One thing you consider is to shoot at a shallow DOF and set the beauty aides at different distances from the camera so that some are in sharp focus and others are soft focused. Also, put some powder on the brush and add the applicators to the two open containers to make it look as though they have just been used. This would imply that beauty has just been created and is very nearby without actually showing it. That is powerful.

The nudity didn't bother me at all - I found it to be both tastefully done and appropriate, given the subject matter.  I think that the image might have been even more powerful without showing the erect nipple.

The right side is almost completely lost to the blown highlight of sky and the fence appears to have been shaken during the shot, causing a crop-wide distraction.  In some ways this is a cool thing as it reaches into the abstract, but the main subject is too clear to force me into that arena.  It appears that there may have been no choice between shutter speed and open aperture.  Both needed to be set to get the exposure, in this case, the fence was out of your control, and a solid tripod would have helped considerably."

It competes with the rainbow for attention.  Also, the post processing looks a little rushed.  There is a clear and noticeable line separating the trees from the sky.  To me it looks like either a little too much use of the clone tool or a composite image.  The rainbow in itself is good, but I think the rest of the image really needs work.  A softer background/foreground would better compliment the rainbow in my opinion."

The hat is a certainly a curiosity, but the stance is charming!  Especially as it is juxtaposed with the rigidly geometric, formal \"body\" formed by the column supporting the bust at the right of frame.  There's a certain whimsical interplay between these three characters: the man considers the painting, the subject of the painting stares back at him (sadly, I think), and the bust lady shyly averts her eyes.",

The trombone player remains in the shadows (which I understand was the challenge of the contest) such that more attention is focused on the trombone. The front of the trombone appears as a flat circle with no defining features - if just a little more light could have been shed just on that spot to show the curve of the metal inward to a darker opening where the music bursts forth from, it would have further defined the object as seperate from the head of the player. Not to mention if that spot was illuminated a little more it would give a better sense of depth. Also I would have liked to have seen more distiction in the fingers of the trombone player. They would still be in shadow for this is a shilouette but it would have been nice to see the fingers \"dancing\" upon this instrument as it is played such that it helps invoke the imagery of music played in the viewer's ears.",

Drama might have been added if you could have caught a hihglight line tracing around the flowers to emphasise their shape and nature: possibly hard or impossible with this type of flower, but easier with flowers that have fluff on their leaves or petals (ie change of fauna being photographed - impractical to find different flowers on this timescale etc. I am sure, but availability/choice of subject will affect scoring dramatically)."

Only thing that detracts from this shot (besides it being an abstract which is pretty much instant death on this site) is that the cases aren't standing perfectly vertically.  some are slightly tilted and it detracts from the inherent geometric beauty in the image.

  "I'd probably give this photo a 3, perhaps a 4 if I were in a good mood. My first impression is that alot more effort could have gone into the preparation of the shot to ensure that the light wasn't so harsh (perhaps using a light reflector to give it some shade?), as there is a LOT of burning along the flower petals, which is the primary point of focus, and the burning, IMO, isn't providing any artistic flair. Also, the colour seems a bit muted or muddy, and the yellow stamens seems to blend in with the pink petals, instead of being more vibrant and popping out. Finally, I think the petals could be a bit sharper in focus, to bring out some of their texture more."

Maybe you were trying something different from the standard longer exposed image with the banks in focus but the strong water flow pattern.

The arrangement, particularly with the lights in the clouds behind it, make it look like a sunset scene, however, which still leaves me *feeling* like it doesn't really fit the challenge, possibly because I can't get over my first impression now.  A title change noting that it is not a sunset might have changed that feeling to a sense of wonder about what exactly is being looked at (e.g. \"In Africa, This Is Not a Sunset\").  The current title, by blending \"today\"/\"tonight\", actively encourages the misinterpretation as a sunset."

The subject is almost too far out of the image, but not quite.  Do like him/her at the edge though.  And going out of the frame works for me.  9 for your excellent use of black.  Good luck in the challenge!"

I'm not looking to have *my* mood affected by an image in this challenge, but to see how photographers capture the moods of their subjects.  You have two subjects here, and neither one of them are emoting any kind of mood to me.  I may feel something, but I don't see your subjects feeling anything, and this is where I think the challenge was trying to get to.  Having the human subject in some other, emotive, pose.. would have been much, much stronger."

The model's facial expression and general body attitude fits quite well with the title, and I think the lighting could be improved upon, but could have also worked.

There is too much unnecessary negative space here, and the object(s) in the upper corner are very distracting.  It's a great, emotive snapshot, but DPC generally demands much more for a higher score..  however, of course, high scores on DPC aren't exactly the end all and be all either, but I must, as a commenter, take the stance that it is what a submitter is striving for."

I would probably crop it below the clouds, as the distance that they are separated from the main subject causes them to distract the attention away from the ship and moon which are the focus of the picture.  Moon reflection on the water really adds to the picture.  Great shot, 9 from me."

  "It's amazing, the english language.  One word can evoke 4 different expressions in one challenge, and 5 photographs.   However, for me, pensive means a hesitant discomfort or fear.. as in a child's first encounter with petting a tame snake.. or similar circumstance.  The mood I am feeling from this subject is one of contemplative anger, or frustration. More along the lines of angst, if you will.   However, this is merely something for you as a photographer to consider for the future, and doesn't affect my scoring."

Perhaps a more intensified look of discomfort, or grumpiness, and I'd have really been able to feel it. As it is, I just sort of get a little touch of disinterest.  It's not *bad*, but it's not hugely moody either.  Outside of a \"Moods\" challenge, the expression and feel are priceless, and I wouldn't change a thing.",

  "As for the expression, I believe this is both a bit of a \"language\" disagreement (for those that disagreed that it was a good title), and a problem of being a little *too* subtle (which I was going for).  While the general meaning I was going for was \"apprehensive\", now that I think about it, I've always used the word \"pensive\" to apply to this meaning as well, a long with most of the people I grew up around.  Obviously, others feel the same way as well, but not everyone does.  Lesson learned.  She really isn't trying to smile here, but was worried because I was trying to get her to have a more \"natural\" expression, and was busy trying to get ready for gymnastics.  I shot off a burst, and when I saw this look, I knew it was what I had to use.   Later on, I got her smiling as well, and that shot is in my portfolio."

That doesn't bother me quite as much as it does many, but with such a simple subject, having it centered doesn't really work that well.  Try framing it so that it shows up either one third from the left or the right instead.  A contrast boost might also be in order, as the scene seems a little washed out.  The subject also doesn't seem to be that compelling."

If I had to pick a little, the top of ball has blown highlights and I think it would of looked better with a lower POV so not as much of the white inside the cup would be showing. The white in the cup comes very close to competing with the ball. Still with that said one of the best I have seen yet. 7"

You have a decent focus on the peacock, but I think that it might be hard for some people to know if you intend the body as the subject or the entirety of the bird.",

I don't find the subject matter especially interesting or striking in any way - at least in the way it is currently presented.  HOWEVER, I think it's a very nice shot - symmetrical, asymmetrical, balanced, decent lighting, and contains two of the three possible elements for this particular theme.  You know, I almost think this content would be more appealing in a black & white or sepia toned image.  It is so severe with the rock/marble and steel doors, that It looks like a death camp in the Middle East or the Sudan, and the person reading the newspaper in red pants seems very out of place against that background...  Sorry."

  "The worn, grainy look does much to humanize the figure. The angular lines and striations vs. the soft flow of greys and the grace of form provide a perfect poise between the nostalgic sentiment found here and a contemporary context. Despite the high-key manner, the contrast is kept conservatively contained in the shadows, which, effectively, avoids the potential impression of forced post-processing and artifice and, instead, credibly anchors the excess of light around a black point."

  "The shadows (hat and back of chair) are bare of tones, but not bare enough to perceive a 'deliberate' contrast. One could, without having to strain, attribute intent to the general softness of the photo, which, combined with the depth of field chosen here, would evoke another era without digital technology, L lenses and USM. This, I think, would not be far fetched, considering the hat, the chair and the surrealism made here (the films of Fritz Lang come to mind)."

Also, try using a wide aperture (low f/stop) to tighten up the depth of focus so those trees in the background will be blurry & not distract the viewer.",

To improve it I think I would have tried moving the subject down the hill to the left so that she was in the first third of the shot and sky was the only background behind her. She would have stood out more. Also this is a fairly soft shot, maybe a little bit more focus on the face would have made her pop.",

Get in closer and reflect some light back into her face, and I think you'll be pleased with the results."

Load the original selection of subject only onto this layer and use dodge and burn at a very low percentage to bring the face up a tad and take the shoulders/arms down a tad. Then make a levels adjustment layer to bring a little visual \"pop\" into the subject, taking care that the hotspot on the nose doesn't go grotesque on you. If necessary, use a little healing brush to bring some borrowed tonality to that hot spot. Finally, make adjustment layers for selective color and, possibly, hue/saturation to warm up her flesh tones and bring her to life."

When photographing people for a challenge, (or for anything in fact) you need to create something that helps a third-party viewer identify with your subject in some way.  You need to make me interested in who I see.  As far as your post processing is concerned, if you achieved what you wanted, it's fine.  The color hues here are a bit strange for me.  The skin tones don't seem normal and there is a blue/green cast throughout the rest of the image, including his hair.  There is nothing wrong with doing things this way, but they need to serve a visible and identifiable purpose when posting them for public review most likely."

The subject does seem to be slightly out of focus, and a tighter crop might have served well here as well, although this one is not necessarily bad.  Because of the subject's uncomfortable pose and facial expression, the shot seems maybe slightly off-balance and another shot a few seconds later when he seemed more relaxed (looks like he is making some kind of movement here) may have worked as well.  One thing to always keep in mind is that a blurry image will almost certainly suffer in the scores, whether it is minor or not (or even intentional).  Hope this helped, and happy shooting!"

  "The deep sepia tones obsure the detail and detract from the overall image.  That's just my opinion and here is the only place it counts.  It makes me work to determine the subject and feel of the image and that gives a veiwer an inclination to make a snap judgement and go onto the next image without rating it on its other merits, which I have resisted.  It is a beautiful sky, but too much of it.  By cropping down to just above the house, so the image is then verticle, the veiwer is then drawn into the subject and it becomes the focus of attention. Tthen_even the deep sepia is not such a deterence."

The metal also appears to be a little OoF (could be to resizing issues at 640).  I also find there is more sky then building and I feel that the building should be the main subject of the shot.  Without the metal fence there I think the shot was composed alright but could have done with a lower angle.  Good luck in this challenge."

  "You've got a good idea going here. Catching the foiage/trees does ad some interest and nice vivid green coloring here, but in this case it might be just a bit too much. Seems to be kind of obscuring your main subject a little too much. Perhaps also framing out a bit of the foreground grass might help some too. Maybe keeping in mind the idea, but finding a different angle/perspective, showing more of the structure, but still with some trees/greenery would make for a stronger photo."

Knowing the style of the artist, It helps me to feel the place where your thoughts are in this. It's great to read your commentary when I view a picture like this. It's a stunning capture and your comments give me some insight into why this is so different from your other work.  A different mind-set, but the talent showing is still quite strong.

To me the first thing I noticed about the actual photo was you cut of the end, making it almost like an incomplete story. I did not vote on this challenge, but had I, truthfully would be in the majority of others, either 4 or 5, depending on MY mood, and that does make a difference with everyone, unfortunatly! Also, not a critique but an opinion, I prefer color almost every time, as I find do most of the dcp'ers, but you have to be true to yourself first, so I try NOT to downgrade images done in sepia, b and w or other mono or duo tones."

I see the subject is placed neatly on the rule of thirds.  It's a safe choice, but I tend to think that it's a little small to fill that space.

I might suggest a different time of day to shoot, so that the sky isnt' quite so blown out, but then again it kind of adds to the starkness of the image.  Some play in curves and contrast might bring a bit more of the textures out of the wood and shingles as well.  Nice work, good luck in the challenge!!!"

I would like to see a little more space at the top of the photo, a bit more \"headroom\" for the subject.  I also don't particularly care for the greenish/yellowish tone, but others seem to like it I 'spose.  There also doesn't seem to be much detail in the shot and I don't know if that's from post editing or the camera (which I'm not familiar with.)  Overall, however, I think it's a very nice catch that conveys a lot.",

Clone that out only because it is a little distracting to me and it is print worthy.  One more suggestion would be to crop a little more off the right of the image to go more toward the rule of thirds.  But the subject is fine where he is in my opinion.  Keep up the good work."

Where the strength of a photo lies in subtle textures  across vast expanses of space, the lack of resolution can really take its toll.  I have the impression that some of that is going on here.  I think, for instance that the texture in the earth is beautiful but I can just barely make it out.  I imagine that the texture in the beautifully lit hills is probably quite beautiful, but in this presentation it looks a little flat.  Perhaps some creative burning would enhance the texture."

I understand that you wanted to bring out the weathered look and you did but by oversharping the complete image everything seems to blends together. I hope that make sense. If you could of sharpened your main subject that you wanted to emphasis weathering and left the other portions of the image alone IMO I believe it would of been more dramatic. As it sits now everything blends and my eyes don't want to focus on the columns and bridges. They bounce all around the picture. On a positive note I believe you composted the picture well and offered us a good POV. I also like the B&W effect."

Increasing the contrast between subject and water using photoshop might make the image more impactful."

The texture of the grass and the yellow flowers here are great positives.  And the rabbit is well framed. The photo has a cluttered look which might be ameliorated by the removal of several sticks, most notably the one just to the right of the rabbit and the one springing from the center at the bottom and going halfway across the image.  The exposure range pushes the limits for digital cameras and It would be nice if even the leaves above the rabbit were in focus.  I think with all these problems solved it could be a solid photo, though I think it would still be a little to subtle for 'stock photograhy.'"

  "Firstly, due to this being a challenge about a naturalist/photographer, it's important to feature a subject that shows some unusual features or at least some normal features shown in an unusual way. Here, you are too far away to achieve much detail and the weather and lighting is flat and dull. Therefore it would be better to get much closer and show some textures and form rather than a conventional landscape that most people can see from their car window. The base of that tree looks quite interesting so I'd have run into that field and got a close, ground-level view looking up at its branches, with a long depth of field. Ideally, you would need a tripod and a longish exposure so that you can get everything in focus."
 ],
 "153018.jpg": [
  "As far as the eye can see there is no subject for this shot.  You don't have leading lines taking you into the shot either.  There is some texture, but it is muted by the lack of contrast.  There is nothing here to hold the interest of the viewer.  An awesome landscape without some kind of subject is just (in this case) a couple of hills..."
 ],
 "153015.jpg": [
  "This is a beautiful photo, and a great subject for a black and white depiction. I think color would have overpowered the wonderful tones present throughout the picture. The composition is great. The major elements fit together nicely (I especially like the way the shape of the foreground bush fits with the shape of the shoreline). And there are plenty of minor elements (like people and boats) to make the photo well worth exploring in detail."

For the challenge that the photo was submitted I think the subject is a bit shallow and the tonal range is a bit limited.  Something else to consider is the composition; a general rule (not an absolute) is to off-center your subject.  The birds are centered vertically and horizontally in this image.  Your focus goes to the birds and there isn't anything else to draw your interest into the remainder of the photo.  Keep having fun!"

This is definitely achievable with treebark, but you need a low sun angle to bring out the contrast effects. This looks for all the world like it was shot on an overcast day - the light is so diffuse that there is no sense of depth or drama in the image at all. To most viewers, I'm sure this comes across as a very ho-hum image, and I imagine you are being plagued by a deafening silence when it comes to comments during voting."

I don\uff0at like how just the tip of the right wing is cut off, it makes it look like it was accidentally done.  The clip on the left wing is very uncomfortable for me since so much of the right wing is showing.  I also don\uff0at like how there is so much space behind the bird and so little in front.  It really gives the picture (for me anyway) the appearance of being a shot where your focal length was too long and you couldn\uff0at keep the bird in the frame while tracking it.  I think the picture might be better if it were cropped a lot tighter so that the right wing was clipped the same amount as the left wing and the space behind the bird was eliminated.  I don\uff0at know if it is my screen but it looks like you have some clipped highlights as well along the leading edge of the right wing and right around the eye of the gull."

I think the use of the candle as the only light source did the image a disservice however because nearly all detail is lost in the shadow.  I'm not good with using low light (it looks as if it was used to give a more intimate feel?) so I don't have any suggestions on what to do differently and keep the feeling you're looking for.   The lack of lighting makes it difficult to see other aspects that may be excellently done.  The composition looks as though it might be good and the idea works.  The lighting just needs a bit more work.  Sorry to harp on that!  I gave the image a 3 since I couldn't really see much of what was going on."

Instead you've taken a position regarding your subject bridge.  It may be a rather wacky position, but at least you're saying something!  So, even though this is not the most technically perfect image, it has an artistic vitality that's missing from virtually all of the many images that will inevitably finish higher in the voting.  Therefore I'll do my tiny bit to redress that.  10"

However, the white balance appears to be off, and the undersaturation doesn't really work - it would be nicer either fully coloured or converted to b&w.  For some reason, my eye doesn't like the space to the left of the bridge - it wants to see the bridge go to the edge of the photo.  The setting is great, though, and the focus and DOF are excellent."

Having both in full focus causes my eye to wander.  I think the focal point of the image is the curved portion in the mid-right of the frame, but am not naturally drawn to that point.  Different angles of that subject might yield some interesting results imho."

  "I like what you tried to do here, but there are a few elements that could use some improvement.  Firstly, the white balance is off - everything has a strange cast to it that is just not appealing.  It feels dreary, depressing, and in general not very inviting.  Second, the trees don't provide atmosphere as much as annoyance.. they are out of focus and blocking the view.  Focus is a problem here.  If you had been standing a bit to the right and knelt down a bit, the view of the bridge through the trees would have been much better.  The colour could be fixed with post processing, or maybe conversion to b&w.  This has a lot of potential, and it does meet the challenge - good effort."

The reflection, a play on the title, is nice because the general darkness around it give it a quiet sense of peace. However, the viewer is left a little hungry for more detail or rather a closer view. Yet, this does not prove a draw back for me because you have managed to create, while not quite a portrait, a pleasing image which carries the more gentle feelings in us all. Bumping up.",
  "i appreciate what you've attempted here, as i tried something similar, but just couldn't make it work.  reflections are very, very tricky.  i like your general composition and choice of colors; i think they very much convey the image you wanted to create.  unfortunately, i think your reflection is coming through a bit too forced, almost as if pasted in.  this is definitely something worth revisiting, possibly outside the constraints of editing rules, as i think you are onto something.  nice effort!"

  "Usually the eyes are eagerly sought in a portrait, however, in this case the downward gaze with eye lids covering most of them, works so well simply because gaze supports the pensive general expression down to the slightly tightly pursed lips. Even a softer background would have been better to maintain attention on the facial feautures. While the lighting is not as dramatic as the expression, the overall effect meets the challenge well. These observations are all minor in comparison to the general insight that this image portrays. Bumping up."

  "Cool presentation with great flair and very well cpmposed as the subject appears as art director/photographer. The profile is great and the position of light meter and camera add to the dynamics specially with the lens cap swing. The blue frocks cements the contrast to the good skin tones. Bumping up."

I do think a shirt version would have impressed me more - no insult intended, it just seems that the subject of the shot is the chest, and I don't think that's what you meant.

The pose in general is flattering though, so you chose well.  It looks like you may have not had the camera on a steady mount, or possibly the focus wasn't set quite right as this image is very soft; it seems that texture is nearly lost in some of the shirt.  You might try this shot with sidelighting from a hardware store work light - nothing fancy.  Just something to bring out your features more.

Strong image, a little let down compositionally for me: I can't help thinking it would be enormously stronger for a crop at the bottom of frame: i think you're relying on a near-double symmetry, but that only serves to weaken the overall impact of that parkland and the flag, and undermine the strength of the sweep of those twin bridges. Won;t be surprised to see it do well, however."

Very good technical studio work, as usual, and I especially like the \"character\" method of this portrait, as it tells me you are also an artist, and a portrait should, in my opinion, tell me something about the subject rather than just a mug shot.  It does, however, have a bit of a posed look with you drawing the camera/photographer, whereas if you weren't looking at the camera, it might appear candid and more natural.  I think that you were going for the dynamic interaction with the viewer though, and you achieved it."

Like you noe shooting portraits, I don't shoot too many landscapes, so this is just by what I see.......My first impression was that the horizon line was crooked, although I dont think it is? Optical illusion? I LOVE your color and feel of the shot, but my MAIN distraction is the hot spot to the bottom left of the sun. Overall i Think its nice, and would LOVE to be there now!"

I'm sure this comes as no great shock to you and most other readers.

Flash has become my worse enemy:) Photographers can tell because a flash lights up in front of subject and washes out any detail that may be there. I just bought me a 100 halagen light gonna start playing soon and any high watts that you can use like say with a desk lamp  would be better then flash.. If you didnt use flash then something to reflect and block some of the bright spots may help:)"

Even thought the background leaves are out of focus the white tips of the leaves grab my attention and draw me away from your pink subject.  This is a very nice composition, but for this challenge I think it would do better if closer to where the bud dominated the picture.  Just my thoughts."

There are a number of everso effective elements to it - the general strength of composition, the vignetting (whether edited or natural it is very useful). But there are elements of the composition that don't really sit very comfortably for me - chiefly your positioning of the bench/tree relative to one another, relative to frame: it leaves me wanting some element toward image left to provide a touch to re-balance things, or perhaps just to balance the composition more to the left, which I realise would mean croping out the end of that branch, but I think that wouldn't hurt in the same way as that slight upsetting of the balance of things does; these are very minor seeming details, but i think they have an exaggerated impact on the final composition. That hut and background behind the tree I think i would have tried to work/process out of the image too - or, if they're wanted, to give them more prominence. For dpc certainly, using levels or whatever to black them out would be preferred."

The impression of haze around the window, the unevenness of it, bugs me just a little: I like the idea of it, but the non-regularity of it somehow makes it seem unsuited to the room, unnatural, almost, out of place. Unless of course that  a processing artefact :-)"

You can fix this by setting your white balance maybe just a little higher ... Depending on your camera if its high end you can do a white, grayscale test to automatic set the white balance for you, this might illiminate the speckled dot look... I have no room to talk when it comes to this but I am learning and trying to improve... I give it a 10  though because its worth it ....Peace frog:)"

  "Several thing come to me when I see a picture like this.  Firstly, this is the 20th of this subject that I have seen in this competetion, what makes this one so unique and interesting?  When selecting a composition for the challenges, you'll find that certain subjects are  rather commonplace and when you come into an overlap situation such as that, yours had better be damn good or you lose simply through association.   The old and new camera is that type of photo.  The old camera that you have on display is really a beautiful subject and has been diminished to a boring catalogue piece of metal.  The background does not enhance the old camera but rather washes it out.  The new camera has glare on it and the whole photo is slightly out of focus. The shot appears to be a show and tell type of photo lacking any creative effort.  The subjects are too centered which also weakens the composition.  Your photo does meet the challenge definition but does not inspire the viewer to look at it any further than that.  Good luck."

The rule of thirds is a rule, but not, imo, a hard and fast rule and should not impede on your creativity or the subject at hand. Look again, which ever way I look at it, think about it, the wood is hampering my 'good' feeling. amazingly enough I had this on a 6 during my 1st and 2 nd run, in the 3rd run I brought it down. well, lets be honest this pic is worth more than below average 5 so i freely and willingly bump it back up to my initial feeling. Play with the pic... it's a good one, play with the crop and contrast, play with levels and curves... this is one pic where monochrome was the right choice...yip, it  definately is worth more than a 5.. bump to 6 as i had it."

I agree in general about the border - would have been worth a .something on the score I think - though inmy opinion some work to bring out the rest of the landscape would have made it feel less PS'd. Not saying it is PS'd, but it feels like it's been deliberately darkened to isolate the 'mill. More definition (not masses, but enough to see that horizon properly), and even some lightening of the sky toward the horizon would have added to that massive sky feel that is so imperative in communicating the feel of the Broads).

Many that rated higher were merely good photos of intrinsically interesting subjects, with a bit of blurry stuff included to \"meet\" the challenge. Moreover, I feel this photo has additional compositional qualities that go beyond this challenge.   Finally, what a bonus to discover a Kiwi took it!",

  "Mundane subject made spectacular by the bokeh effect.  What makes it so striking for me is that the in-focus elements are not confined to the nominative subject ... the strong diagonal slashes of the leaves almost appear to be slipping in an out of sharp focus, creating the illusion of movement, as well as an abstract feel.  If I imagine it with ONLY the seed head in focus, it would not have the impact you have achieved.  And of course, if it were ALL in focus, it would be nothing at all.  So I think that is what's meant by bokeh.  Also like the absence of any competing colours.  Very, very good.  I learned a lot from this photo.  Thanks!  10."

The symmetry of both the vertical and horizontal planes are balanced effectively and conservatively by placing the subject outside of it, moving away from anything central without any danger of getting pulled to the margins.

The bokeh is good here, and complements the subject well. Focus seems just a bit off, but I can't tell if the focus is just in the wrong spot (subject moved after focus lock but before shutter activation), the depth of field is too shallow, or it's caused by the subtle compression artifacts.

The second spot that grabs my attention is the bright section of road at the top of the image. The difficulty is, neither of these two spots are the subject of the image.

I do like how the bridge is framed, and I like the mountains/hills in the background.

Not the easiest subject to get really great contrast, but you seemed to handle it pretty well.

The power lines form a good diagonal point of interest.  Late or early day lighting may have added more drama, or a bolder sky could punch this up some.

  "Not being a paying member I didn't vote on this challenge, so this is my first hard look at your image.  My first impressions are that you've captured a very pleasant looking scene but the trees look a bit over saturated or bright for the cloud cover in the image (It makes the picture look unbalanced).  Compositionally, the image is really strong.  The curve of the shoreline provides a wonderful leading line and the balance between the clouds, land, and water is very nice.  What is weak about this image is the subject matter.  Although pleasant to look at, this shot has nothing that really holds the viewer's attention.  The clouds add interest to the background but don't work as a main subject.  The trees haven't changed color enough to be the main subject.  The shoreline shows no activity and has very little color (mostly white boats and covers).  And the reflection in the water isn't strong enough to be the main subject either.  So, is this a bad image?  No.  It is very nice and one that I would be proud to have in my portfolio.  However, it doesn't have enough of that DPC look to score in the 6's, especially in a free study challenge with over 600 entries."

  "I love your subject too.  He looks as though he's been glossed over with a bit of gritty pop that makes him really stand out against the background and yet retain some fantastic but subtle textures.  His tattoos really jump off his skin and that gives the eye some other areas to explore and wonder about too - there is a red line on the neck that seems overly saturated though.   The clarity is good, though it does seem a bit soft on his face and upper body... that said the eye is generally caught by the gleaming pegs on the guitar and so the man's face is almost rendered blurred because my eye isn't paying attention to it anyway.   I like what you've done with the guitar, the bright metal and the sparkle really create a sub-main subject within the bigger main subject, which is a nice layering effect compositionally.",
  "Many folks would dismiss this image as not being worthwhile since it isn't pure photography but I really like how you've melded traditional photography with some digital art elements.  I think the subject lends itself very well to that practice and what you've done here is take the best of both worlds and merge them.  This could have come across as overdone or sloppy but you've done an excellent job.  My few nitpicks -  the pants striking me as looking a bit odd, the repeating detail in the wall (where the two lines are much lighter than the rest of the wall), and the man's upper body being softer than I'd like - are definitely overshadowed by the areas I think have been very well done."

The story has to be told either qucikly or in a dramatic fashion so as to hold th interest untill the teller if finished.  He looks like he is doing a flip, or falling down.

The light on the postman is a bit overposed and it stands out against a black background.  The green in the house in background also stands out; I would reduce your F-stop as much as you can to blur the background.  Since this was advanced editing you could do that in PS or another  program."

The post work on the color is also nice, but the vinetting is a little obvious and overwhelming.  While I do like the effect and agree that it's appropriate for the image, it's a bit apparent where it starts and stops and feels like a layer just hovering over the photo rather than an active part of the photo itself.  You may want to look into different ways of achieving that look, or perhaps just lower the intensity somewhat.

It looks great in black and white, and the details like the girl's white dress and black boots further work to enhance that choice.  I also like the fact that her face is obscured; it adds a sense of mystery and also helps the tree remain a focal point.  I think a little extra dodging and burning may help to add even more punch and definition to the image, but that is just personal choice.  Overall, I think this is a strong image.",

Yes, there's a single tree, but I think you'd be hard pressed to show this picture to random strangers on the street and get a response that the tree is the main subject of the image.  As far as the image itself is concerned, the composition is very nice, and the image is sharp, so good points for that.  I'm not crazy about the sepia tone, but that could just be personal preference.  Maybe try starting out with the original colors and then lower the saturation for the channels you don't want to emphasize as much.  That way we don't lose the rich colors of the ocean or the sky, but you still have control over the feel of the image.  All in all, I think this photo is fine - but I think you will lose points for the ship taking center stage."

Second, the image has a lot of noise (looks grainy in film jargon).  There are free programs available to reduce noise if you do an Internet search.  Third, it appears that the image is out of focus.  This could be a result of not sharpening the image after resizing, camera shake (Not using a tripod in low light conditions), or not taking full use of the allowable file (Your file 29 kb - Allowable file size 150 kb)."

Firstly, I think the overwhelming issue I notice before all else is the head position.  As mentioned it looks TERRIBLY uncomfortable.  While it may not have been, the impression actually does leave a residue on how I view the image, and does so negatively.  I think its the combination of her head being turned to a rather extreme-looking degree and her head then being tilted upwards as well and the smile looking just a bit forced as a result."

Perfect...to me, it's meeting the challenge first above anything else - that's where I start: at a 5. Then from there I give more or less points for photo quality, difficulty of photograph, edit and lastly, I try not to judge the subject by my personal interest in it. I also pay attention to the title - if it's 'Art' then tell me where there is an artist that does not carefully name their work? I feel in this challenge, the rules are SPECIFIC...rule of thirds...plural...not third...singular. Juding by your title...I think you also feel strongly about this. From reading some of the forum threads, I feel I may be one of the 'DPC Nazis' - however, if I really, really like a photo, I give it a break. In your photo...however boring (I think) the subject is...everything about it is totally perfect for this challenge. It should be used as an example for future reference. I hope you win the blue! 10 This!",

  "Nice job on your first challenge entry.  During the challenge, I rated this image a 5.  My first impressions were that the subject met the challenge but was sort of common, the image looked a little flat, and that it could use a bit more sharpening.  For the image presented, the most improvement would be achieved by bumping the contrast and saturation and by applying some USM (Sharpening) after resizing.  If your computer has Microsoft Photo Editor, try AutoBalance (In the Image menu) and sharpening (Effects Menu) with a setting of 1.  Even with this very basic editing program, you will notice quite a change with just these two adjustments."

  "Photo appears tilted to the left.  I think in part that is due to the tilt of the tree and the slope of the ground, but also in part I think it is just tilted to the left.  Lot of your main subject has been cropped out of the photo and I'm not sure why.  This appears to have been taken with a wie angle lense given the amount of distortion that is visible, so it shouldn't have taken more than a few steps backward to get everything in frame.  Normally I like the inclusion of things like fences in a shot as they provide some added interest, but the height of this broken down fence distracts from the tree and clutters what would have otherwise been a nice sunrise horizon.  Good luck."

  "There are spots on the flower that is in the 1/3rd position.  However, you have all three competing for the subject.  If you intended the grouping to be the subject it is centrally located and not fitting this criteria. Which is how I am reading it.  There are two ways that I can think of at this moment to correct that.  use a very shallow dof and have the larger flower in focus and the other two blurred out.  Since they are further from the camera, it should be possible.  The other way is to move the angle of the camera.  Instead of top down,  go from the side about 45 degrees from the horizontal plane so you can see the center of the flower.  Use a shallow dof to show depth.  Looks like the lighting is good for this subject."

  "Back to comment: Sorry to be so blunt but this image doesn't really convey Simple Pleasures to me.  On the technical side, your image has a couple of compositional issues that could be improved.  First, the cropping is a little tight to the scarecrow's hat at the top of the image.  Second, the placement of the scarecrow should be more to the left so it is looking into the negative space in the image instead of away from the negative space.  I suggest you review the winning images in the Rule of Thirds challenge to get a better feel for subject placement."

Coming back to review this image, it dawned upon me that the scariness could have been muted by cropping out half of the negative space above the girl.  This would have made the trees look a little less ominous and by eliminating the bright light coming through the trees, provided a softer feel to the image to reflect the intentional desaturation."

But then the really soft petal just left of the stem has a really sharp area, and then the petal that appears to be behind the soft petal is sharp again.  Thus the flower because of the stem, appears to be facing away, yet a petal that would appear to be further away than the stem or the soft petals appears sharper.  I wind up wondering exactly how is this flower built, what parts am I looking at?  There just aren't enough visual clues, and the dominat parts around the subject are very soft.  So the sharper petal on the left competes with the rest."

There are 2 main lines dividing the image visually and they are perfectly at the 1/3rd positions.  The horizon and the line of shadow under this first broken  piece even though it isn't seen all the way across. I think this is one of the best examples of this challenge so far."

I would love to have a nice crisp view of the subject's face so I could see that focus and determination clearly.

The lamps are sharp but lead us almost off teh edge of teh frame, and then we have to cross over them to follow the shoreline and road.",

I can tell you put some thought into the composition of this image by the placement of the three roses at the rule of thirds nodes.  Still something doesn\uff0at look right.  As I looked at your image for a few minutes it came to me.  If you pretend that the roses are people, all three are facing out of the picture.  No matter where the viewer looks, their eyes are directed away from the image instead of to its strong point, the opened rose.  The best suggestion I have for this image is too crop out the two buds and focus entirely on the open rose.  There is some wonderful colors and detail in this rose to work as a sole subject and hold the viewers attention."

It seems like here, the focal plane is just a little off. It looks like the nose, mouth area and beard are sharper than the eyes. Also, lighting wise, it is very harsh on the side of his head, that whole bright area is blown out. And the 'vignetting' thing, don't know if it is natural or added in post, but for me, it just doesn't seem to work for this image.",

However, being lighter than the shoreline, my eyes tend to want to rest on the rocks, which is your intent.  But the rocks don't have enough punch to them and could be lightened just a bit.  I think a little work in post processing with either curves or levels could help balance this image.  Once the rocks have more pop, I would suggest that you try a few different crops (less sky, remove the two boats on the ends, or both) and see how the mood of the image changes.  You have a good eye for composition and I look forward to seeing more of your entries."

Your image fits the challenge well but the subject you chose was a little busy, with lines going everywhere, shady and sunny areas, and what ever that is in the bottom left corner.  The only suggestion I might have to improve your score would be to zoom in on one the elemental groups in your image to simplify the composition.  My choice would have been the tightly grouped bunch of reeds in the upper right corner, the ones that have the strong sun light.  I think this image is done about a well technically as you could have done and I look forward to seeing more of your work in future challenges."

The interaction between the water and the shoreline and the large rocks in the center of the image are both stronger focal points than the voters were looking for.

I'm not sure if you meant to frame the mask on the wall with Natan's arms.  If you meant to, then it's almost centered in the picture (see the rule of thirds) and is small for a point of interest.  If you didn't want that effect, then a shallower depth of field to isolate Nathan from the background would have helped.  The triangular lighter colored object sticking out from behind Nathan's forearm also interrupts the flow of the picture.  Overall lighting, focus, color, and saturation are done well.",

  "Colors are great, and saturation/contrast/exposure and hues are all very well done.  I really like the reflection of the clouds, across the face of the building.  It definetly adds interest and texture to the picture.  Your choice of subject matter was a good one.  Only two things come to mind, in this very well done photograph.  First is focus.  I'm not not sure if it isn't just an illusion, but things look a bit soft along the black lines.  Maybe it's just me, or a trick played by the lines as some sort of optical illusion.  The other is the patch of sky at the upper left.  Since this is an advanced editing challenge, if you had made it darker, or more of a contrast or even a compliment to the other colors, it might have added to the picture.  As it is, you have these great colors, with a little bland bit at the upper left corner.  I don't think just cropping it out would have worked either, because you would have lost too much of the rest of the picture.  So unless you could have found a better angle, the sky bit needs to be in there.  Overall a very good picture, as exemplified by your score.  Well done!"

  "I think you chose a subject for this challenge with a lot of potential.  The texture of the wood siding would have provided a pleasing area for the eyes to wonder if the texture was consistent across the whole image.  The glare on the right side of the image hides the wonderful texture and might have been prevented if taken at a different time of the day.  As is, the right side is a little harsh to look at so my eyes are drawn to the left and coming to rest on the window.  If you decide to re-shoot this image in different lighting, I would suggest a tighter crop to eliminate the non-siding portions of the image on the left and at the bottom.  The texture and lines of the siding are perfect for a No Subject image and eliminating the background clutter would strengthen their appeal IMHO."

  "An interesting choice of subject but I think that you should either crop it closer to the buoy or zoom in closer. Your main subject is literally swimming in a vast water that is largely uninteresting to look at. Now yes, that does call our attention instantly and directly to the colors & shape of the buoy, but you could do that just as effectively if you presented the viewer with a closer look at the main subject. Bring the buoy to us, make it dominate the scene and strengthen the visual impact by zooming in to make the buoy occupy 70% or more of the composition. Those bold red and the white hues would visually 'pop' off of the flat grey water if it made up 70% of the compositon. A square crop could even more of a dynamic to the visual because it tightens the focus on the subject even more AND it can be a subtle addition of just another shape juxtapositioned with the round shape of the bouy. Good idea and holds promise but the presentation needs improvement.",

  "I really like the unusual angle that this is taken from. It really adds visual interest to this picture of a cow. Square crop keeps the main subject the focus of our attention. I look at the title and it innvokes the idea that ol' bettsy is just a number (0860) from a very large farm of cows that you cannot see in the picture. It calls up the idea of this cow being just one of a large herd all the while it depicts it as an individual in the photograph. The critique I have on this photo is that the lighting on the cows face is too dark that one cannot see it's eyes. They say the eye's are the windows to the soul - and when it comes to establishing a connection or human interest to a photo of a person or animal it is the eyes that can really grab & hold the viewer's attention. Perhaps an slightly slower shutter speed or lower ASA would have let more light come in to illuminate the eyes OR you could use selective editing to up the gamma, brightness & contrast just around the eyes to get them to be more visible."

You need a less transparent backdrop or dispense with the backdrop and have the background look industrial.

Also, the flyaways in the hair look unkempt instead of sexily rumpled, as I expect was the intent. As for the lack of shirt front, it doesn't hurt the shot, but it isn't really adding that much to it either. A style of shirt and pose that gave some hint of curves instead of simply showing cleavage would be more enticing."

Me?\" I only have one critique, a small one at that, they both look so cute that one wants to get closer to them.

Overall you did a super job with the flower in front of the face and simulating the background blur. There appears to be some yellow color bleeding remaining on top in front of the \"lost photographer's\" head but a little additional cloning takes care of that. A bit more 'cloning' and 'blur' fixes that up just fine."

I think the highlights are fine, however people might have responded better to the photo if you'd used a subject where the background leaves were lit better so they'd have a more pleasing green colour, and the highlights wouldn't be as prominent. The dark shadows don't really help the image much. A good effort though. Met the challenge well."

  "I like this capture of what looks to be a natural pose of the model. It seems to me that she glanced over to look at you just as you pressed the shutter. As such her eyes are turned to us and it is as if we are the ones caught looking. And indeed, the eyes are a lovely shade of blue. She is adorned with all sorts of interesting jewelry and decor. Lighting and skin tones on the subject are excellent. I do have one critique and that is don't be afraid to get even closer to your subject. Either a closer crop or a zoom in where the bottom half cuts off just below the silver bracelet would make a stronger visual impact. The reason? Her face, her eyes, the interesting jewelry on her wrist (expecially that beaded diamond patterned bracelet), and the Henna pattern on her hand would dominate the composition more."

I suspect you got caught between a really bright sky, darker subject and background, and needing to stop the action cold.  It all adds up to me to a so-so shot not connected to the challenge.  3."

The problem here is that it's inconsistant on this photo.There a spot between the performers leg and the ladder that is sharper even though it shouldn't be. The woman watching too. Good luck and this is only my humble opinion."

As for the image, the angled placement of the subject helps - it's still a bit centered.  Some shadows falling on the right end of the rope could be eliminated with a light reflector to fill.  I keep getting distracted by what appears to be some text under the paper on the left center side of the photo.  All of the above is JMO of course.  ;^)"

The other thing that I would consider is to crop out the stick in the foreground, for some reason My eye goes right to it every time that I look at the photo. I know we really cant control the weather either, but I think it would contrast the boats better if you had a blue sky day. I know this really happens for me so I am kind of glad im not the only one with gray sky photos (no offense or nothing)."

  "First and foremost, you have a doll of a subject here, so adorable, hard to go wrong with that!",
  "First is the positioning of your main subject - the pup is smackdab in the middle of the photo.  This kind of setup is fine in general but can also put the breaks on a creative or artistic flow.  This also probably is one of the reasons a previous commenter asked what the subject was, the rocks or the dog since they both seem to be getting equal time.  I would suggest cropping the bottom of the image to help bring the pup down lower in the shot and thus give him(?) more of a starring role in the image.  In scrolling the image on my screen I think cropping off about where the two lower rocks meet up would do the trick.  This effectively lowers the dog, creating a sort of 'ground' line while both still giving the rocks the ability to create the atmosphere you were going for and it also opens up the top portion of the image too, makes it feel stretched and higher and more purposeful to me."

The simple white one would suffice, or maybe none at all. I'm sure the sunset is beautiful in focus. Hope this is helpful. ;~D"

With his knee and chin both in front of the pine tree, the concept of the tree being up his nose is no longer plausible.  This image also suffers from the harsh lighting conditions.  Either the contrast needs to be adjusted to put the man in complete silhouette or you need to use fill flash when the sun is behind the subject."

There is a lot of life, clarity and action in the sparks and whatnot so it makes the duller, less lit fingers look subpar in comparison.

Its a well thought out composition and setup. I wish it wasnt so tightly cropped on the left with so much negative space on the right. I would have liked to have seen the top of the bottle as well. The only other thing is the flash reflection on the bottle. Overall very well done, I would have scored this a 6 on initial look and depending on the rest I may have bumped it to a 7 later on. Nicely done and good luck with future challenges."

  "I didn't vote on this challenge so this is the first time I've looked at your image critically.  My first impression of this image is \"Wow, this has a lot of stuff going on\".  To the voter, this means that there isn't one true focal point to the image to lock in on visually except for the color.  And in this challenge, the color is pretty common.  There are a couple of areas within this image that are competing with each other and neither one wins.  First, there are the two fire pots on the left.  The spacing difference between these two pots and the two on the right make it difficult to choose which group is more important.  Second, the pots at the top of the image almost look like they were partially cropped off (Most probably something is blocking the view).  Actually cropping the top fire pots might have helped the image but leaving their reflections in the water would have looked odd.  When all is said and done, you probably should have simplified the composition by zooming in on just one of the groups."

The peas are underexposed and in shadows.

All of this is JMO of course.  ;^)  Good luck in the challenge."

Namely the girls behind are just not seperated out enough, a slightly smaller DOF may have helped that. I don't know the DOF from it, so can't help you there, but it would have helped the seperation.",
  "#1 - Selective Desat/blur   Unless it is done really well, very subtly, and has a strong reason (other than to simply differentiate your subject from a cluttered background), it's going to score poorly.  Your shot was, quite simply, none of these things.  Yes, I understand that not every shot can be taken with the subject against a non-cluttered background, but there are things that can be done to minimize such things.  As for the technicals.. they are done pretty well, but they are still pretty glaring.  People notice that it's fake.  I certainly did, and that's a sure way to a 5 (or 4)",
  "#3 - Overall Pop.  There really isn't one.  What is there because of your processing is actually taken away by.. your processing.  It's too noticeable, and the only real pop you have going here is the fact that your subject is the only one in color.  It's simply not enough.",
  "Great image.  I like the choice of selective desaturation, really makes your subject stand out.  The image is very crisp and clean and the expression on the girl's face is excellent, very emotive.  Obviously meets the challenge.  The few nitpics I have is the arms look overly processed a bit, particularly in the bicep area to me, sort of soft and slightly blurred.  I also wish I could see more of the girl's face, especially with that happy look she has.  Quite lovely.  I gave 6"

  "I didn't vote in the Fire II challenge so this is the first time I've taken time to look at your image critically.  Overall you chose a very strong subject for this challenge that should have scored higher than the five that it did.  This would indicate that there were technical or compositional issues with your image.  It is my belief that the primary issue was compositional.  My first impression when I looked at your image was \"Wow, there is a lot going on in this picture\".  In your image there are two primary focal points competing for the viewer's attention, the side reflected candles on the left and the back reflected candles on the right.  Since the back reflected candles are more aesthetically pleasing than the left reflected candles, this image should have been cropped to eliminate the reflected candles on the left.  You might want to consider using a square crop to eliminate the reflections off the shelf as well, as these reflections also compete against the wonderful grouping of candles on the right."

  "Looking at the voting histogram for this image I must confess that I am confused.  How five people could score this a one I have no idea.  Your subject was peas and definitely met the challenge.  The idea was simple but well executed.  A person would have to be blind to miss the humor.  The lighting was well done, as the peas have good color, texture, and the shadows help to give a three-dimensional look to the peas.  The only suggestion I have for improvement would be to use a square crop for this image, as the negative space to the right doesn't really add to the composition.  Your score was solid for such a simple idea but it should have been higher IMHO."

 "378718.jpg": [
  "I didn't vote on this challenge so this is the first time I've looked at your image critically.  I think your score is result of a combination of two things, your subject choice and a couple of technical issues.  One commenter mentioned that toys don't do well in DPC challenges.  I'm not experienced enough in the DPC ways to confirm that but a toy soldier as the main subject when fire is the assigned subject is not the way to garner high scores.  Compositionally, you did a nice job of setting this shot up.  The soldier is located in a good location and all of the pieces fit together well.  On a technical level there are things that could be improved.  You made the right choice on using fill flash to help bring out the details in the soldier.  Unfortunately, the soldier doesn't have a lot of detail to begin with and the fill flash was just a bit strong, causing harsh reflections and strong shadows.  If you could have used a couple of light sources from the side, preferably as reflected light, the soldier might have come off looking a bit more 3 dimensional.  I hope you find something within this critique helpful and feel free to PM me if you have any questions."

There are less than 1,000 of these cars still in existance today and it's only a 2002 model.  There's more corvettes on the road than there are of this car.  But why do I get the impression this would have scored better if it had been a Corvette or similar car?? WTF gives.  I do appreciate all of the technical comments and all I have to say is I do what I can with what I have and did infact use a polarizer...although a fairly cheap polarizer.

The issue with shooting into the sun is that the colors of your subject tend to look flat.  This image could have used a bit more saturation to make the jumper stand out more.  However, just bumping the saturation would have made the jumper's skin look too red so you would need to play around to determine which colors to selectively saturate (Blues and greens probably)."

The only suggestion I have to improve this image is to try using a square crop to eliminate some of the dead space at the top of the image.  As presented, the section of tree branch without any fruit and the section of sky without clouds at the top of the photo act as negative space with no real purpose.  I would suggest cropping the top of the image down to just below the node where the branch holding the top pear meets the main branch.

  "\"Great Job\" from the \"Great Job Baggie\"!  Wow.  I hardly know where to begin.  So, I guess anywhere is a good place.  The background.  Extraordinary use of color.  Eye-popping color.  The subject.  Very well executed, and a very sweet and sentimental subject.  The position of the subject in the shot is a nice touch, coming from the upper left, moving downward and toward the center of the canvas.  The whispery feeling of the girl's dress, and the way it fades away into the color is a very nice addition.  The ONLY little thing that I find distracting to the softness of this photo is the boots on the girl.  They just don't fit the overall mood of the shot.  A small distraction, but something I feel.  I don't know if barefoot, or a simple sandal with clean lines would have been better, and less distracting.  This sounds like a fasion comment now, LOL.  Anyway, I'm upping your photo from an 8 to a 9 after a second glance.  The boots is what keeps me from giving it a 10.  Definately a beauty tho!"

  "\"Great Job\" from the \"Great Job Baggie\"!  I originally gave you an 8 on this one, but after second glance, I see qualities that make it even more worthy.  First off, the subject matter is very original and different.  Not that there aren't other aircraft shots out there in this challenge, but that your aircraft is not a modern one.  The colors in this shot are super, especially the yellows.  The darker blue body of the aircraft against the blue sky tends to blend in, making the bright colors seem even brighter.  The smoke trail really lends a bit of interest to this photo."

Even if you did go through the trouble of making sure he was ok when shooting this take after take.

I scored this one a 7 because I felt it was a strong subject choice for the challenge and that you executed your idea very well.  I've never shot infrared and have seen very few of these types of images but if you scan through the challenge archives, you will see that infrared images are not the norm at DPC.  Comparing your entry to some of the other infrared images submitted in other challenges, your image doesn't have nearly as much contrast as the higher scoring images.  I think if you could have made the leaves look a little whiter, it would have met the infrared expectations of the general DPC population a bit more.  Is that possible in this image without blowing out the sky?  If not, then shooting during a different time of day may have produced a stronger infrared result.",

If you look at the image closely, all of the rule of third nodes have nothing with real detail to command attention.  The focus isn't the best, as the only place I can find that is sharply focused is the edges of the green car and since that is located near the edge of the image, it leads the viewer's eyes out of the image instead of holding their interest."

  "You captured a very lovely image that has a painting like appeal to me.  As stated in your own comments, this image has no clear main subject and thus, left the voters little to lock onto emotionally.  Because of that, the pile of sand at the bottom left becomes a substitute main subject to the viewer's eyes for a short period of time due to its size and brightness.  This might have scored better if you had cropped out the beach at the bottom portion of the image and placed the dock and the finger of beach next to it about 1/3 up from the bottom of the image.  This would have given the image a focal point of the fishermen on the dock and the beach finger with the dock and beach finger acting as leading lines.  You might also consider darkening the clouds just a bit to portray the storm aspect of your title better.  As is, the clouds have about the same hue as the mountains and don't look all that threatening."

One on either side of the subject and one near me. the side lights I usually have one point somewhat up and one point somewhat down relative to the subject's body. The one near me is usually a bit higher than the person's head, but not always. Always higher if they are wearing glasses. If I am shooting with a white background, I point the side lights up and down as before but pointing more towards the background than the subject."

At first I cringe when I see this shot, because I wonder who's gonna pick up that mess.  After that initial feeling, I find a photo that is very sharp, very detailed, with an interesting subject entering from the side of the photo.  Nice touch on that.  Nice how the wrist overlaps your border too!  That was a very nice touch.  Love the simplicity of the backgrond, and the movement of the cards.  With that being said, who's picking up that mess?

You might want to check out the tutorial section, as fotomann has written a very nice piece on b&w conversions.  Second, the straight on angle you used to capture this image is not very interesting and give the picture a snapshot like appearance.

The image just seems a little boring probably because the subject is centered, it's wheels are down and there is nothing in the background to suggest this plane was indeed in the air and in motion when you captured it. Now I don't doubt that it was but the photo doesn't convey that in any way beyond the fact that it appears to be suspended in midair. I think the images that will do well are the ones that have stop motion but still retain the feeling of motion either by seeing the background in motion or other elements to suggest it. That's really the only blemish I see with your photo which would work perfectly in any aviation periodical so that's no knock on your image in general.",

He appears to be looking toward the camera, we have an interesting angle on him, and he's the largest part of the photo.  In my opinion, he's the main subject of the photo.  That being said, the lighting on that horse is horrible.  The only thing making him not a complete silhouette is the small section of light on his nose.  Even his eyes are completely darkened in.  As someone else suggested, a fill flash might have helped to give the left horse some more detail.  A different time of day, or maybe a different day might have helped with the dull sky as well."

If you could have captured two or even all three in the air this might have been cooler.  It's too bad the subject was facing away from the sun.  I understand he did that so that he could see what he was juggling, but from a photographic standpoint this didn't work so good.  Too much shadow in his face.  I would like to be able to see him looking at the knife.  I don't know if fill flash would have helped this or not.  Probably not as you shot way faster than the flash can synch to."

In general I rate images on the premise that out of the box entries meet the challenge and then rate the photo as to how well you executed your idea.  However, your subject was a little weak on action and your scored suffered from such by the voters overall.",

I do somewhat disagree with you regarding the lady being there.  I found that she helped me understand that there were pathways between the fences and helped provide depth to the image.  As for the B&W conversion, I very surprised how well your camera does B&W; however, I agree with that more contrast is needed in Dorothy's clothes.  You might want to consider shooting in color next time and doing your B&W conversion in post processing.  This link is an excellent tutorial on B&W conversion and is easy to use.  I think if you give it a try you will see that you will not have to dodge and burn as often.",

Compositionally you have the rows of wood centered, which works, and the subject drastically off-centered yet balanced with the girl on the far right.  Great eye to see this image come together.  The B/W tone also works well to help isolate the lighter colors (whites) in the girls and dog.  Non-comforming, yet impressing!  Good luck in the challenge."

  "I remember this image from when I voted on the Action Shot II challenge.  I gave you a 5 on this image because you definitely met the challenge but the image has a couple of technical shortcomings.  First, the image appears to be tilted to the left and that always gets marked down score wise at DPC.  If you would have used the roadway as your horizon and straighten the image accordingly, your score would have been closer to the 5 I gave you.  Second, Zoe has very sharp focus, while Elmo is not.  Since Elmo is the subject with the most action, the viewer looks more to Elmo for sharpness than at Zoe.  Lastly, I think the image could use a little adjustment in levels or with contrast and brightness.  The colors in this image are wonderful but there isn't enough contrast and that makes the image look a little flat.  If you have any questions regarding this critique, feel free to send me a PM."

My first impression was Wow. As you can tell from the comments made during voting, this is not the strongest subject choice for a Stopped Action challenge.  However, chasing a butterfly is not easy and you surly did a nice job capturing this one.  One suggestion I can offer is to crop just a little bit off the top of the image.  If you crop the image so that the purple flower intersects the upper left corner, it becomes a very strong leading line to your butterfly.  As cropped, the flower acts more like a leading line out of the image.  This is an image that you should be proud to have in your portfolio."

  "Lovely.  Very organic and though the smoke is in a bit of a tangle I think the shapes it is creating and the nature of the subject itself lends the image to feeling free and light instead of busy/noisy.  The lighting looks great and I like the composition.  I really like how the smoke kind of has a similarity to some asian writing characters.  I think the focus is a bit soft, but working with smoke its probably hard to get tack-sharp focus.  I definitely feel the zen and I like the simple display of this image.  I gave a 7"

  "I can find zen in the way the rocks line up and contrast the curve of the body, I also like the tones between the rock and the skin.  I don't really like the candles.  While they help set the stage of the image in general I don't find them to add anything to the zen and in fact I find them distracting me from the main subject of the rocks.  I would love to see this with a more balanced image of just the body with rocks on it, no towel/material on the hip and no candles on towel/material in the background.  Just black, curving skin, line of rocks and more skin.  I think the lighting is a bit too harsh for the image, maybe something a bit softer would give an added glow to the skin, or if not softer more of a fill from the lower hidden shoulder area.. I'm not sure.  The focus isn't completely there, so if that could be a bit more clear I think it'd really make this image pop.   I really like the idea and potential of this shot and while it isn't spot on for me, I think its very nice.  I've bumped it from a 5 to a 6"

  "Very delightful.  I like this image in general outside of a challenge mindset.  That said it definitely has zen aspects to me.  I think I understand that you wanted to depict hiding behind the brush and peeking in on the zen moment the swan creates but I find the grass being the most focused part of the image to be a bit distracting because I'm wanting to see beyond it and have the swan more in focus.  I'm not sure how that dynamic change would play out and if the grass would then become an irritant as being an out-of-focus barrier of sorts.  I like the way you handled the natural light and I think the composition is great. I am bumping this up from a 5 to a 6"

I think the focus looks very good as well.  Were it my preference I would've cropped the image right above where that orangey hued one was, I've scrolled the screen to block that out and to me the resulting photo seems to emphasize not only the play of light but also that one stem that's reaching out further than the others into the semi-darkness.  Great photo.  I gave a 6"

I especially like the way the blownout right is balanced by the shadows in the back.  The rock/clay has some great details.  While I do like the negative space shown above, I wish either the crop was tighter on the left or more space was given on the left so the subject felt more cradled into the corner of the image.

I think the pristineness (is that a word?) of her outfit really contrasts nicely with the dark, rough dirt of the rocks too.  She has a lovely smile on her face and that helps give the image a feeling of intimacy.  While I do think this is a very well done portrait technically I don't find much in the way of Zen in it.  Zen is of course a personal thing so it's likely to be different for everyone.  I gave a 5 for its technical merits and would've scored it higher if I could sense the Zen."

  "I think this is a lovely seascape but I am not feeling very zennish about it as a viewer.  I'm not sure why either.  Perhaps its the composition.. the model is a very prominant subject of the image, maybe if there was more space and she was actually just a very small aspect and thus the relationship between her and the big big world would make for an interesting zen experience or if she were more to one side. it may also be because I don't get an innate feeling of harmony or stillness from this image and that's mostly because of all the detail and texture the rocks and scrubbrush provide.  I'm not sure.. I'm definitely no zen expert so I can only comment on what the image instills in me.  I hope this helps.  I gave a 5"

  "For what it is worth, I rated this image as 6.  Although the pose looks like the bird is gliding, the blurry tips of the wings indicate that it was actually flying.  So for that it definitely meets the challenge.  This image does have a few technical issues, some of which are mentioned in the comments from the voters.  First, the image lacks any kind of detail to hold the viewers attention.  Part of this is due to photographing a black subject against a gray sky.  The gray sky has no details to highlight and being significantly lighter than the main subject makes it difficult to capture detail in the bird.  What little detail is there is not very sharp (like the beak).  You might want to wait to use USM until after you have resized your image, as some detail is lost during resizing.  Another alternative is to use USM before and after resizing and if things start to look a little odd after the last USM operation, reduce the strength of USM to 50 to 70 instead of 100.",

  "Now, let's talk about some general thoughts that come to mind while browsing through your port. First off, sharpness. There could be several factors here. For one thing, do you use a tripod? It can help immensely, especially if you are prone to camera shake. If hand held, keep your shutter speed up and really concentrate on being solid and steady. Again, the size and quality of your upload will affect the look of the image greatly. Also, you can check the sharpness setting on your camera. Generally with dslr's though, a lot of shooters prefer the camera to not sharpen at all, and do it with control in post processing. Dslr's also just by design, normally give softer images. I am not familiar with your software, and what it has. Usm (unsharp mask) is the standard that most folks use for sharpening, and newer software has smart sharpen that some like. (there is also a tutorial on sharpening) There are free downloadable software available, such as Gimp, that some folks like."

Lots to satisfy in my opinion, with the subject mattter, the interesting position of the individuals, and what comes off as work done to make the eye wander around the frame quite a bit.  I really enjoy how the man's face is completely hidden, and the woman's face is in shadow completely.  Makes for a terrific candid.  What's also great is the contrast between her white hand, and his dark, larger hand which at first glance appears to be holding hers, but isn't, if I see correctly.  I enjoy the dark background at top: nothing else is needed except these two people, what's going on, and their representation in the great contrasts you've managed.",

However the image is very clear and has great color and the reflection adds that much more to the photo then it would have without.  There's also no noticable finger prints on the glass which is refreshing not to see.  Nice Ad style shot and something I will expect to see passing a billboard on the highway one day.  Well done and good luck in this challenge.  <6>",
  "it's a good idea, but i think it's a pity that the foam didn't go to the top of the glass...  the image also feels a little flat and two dimensional - i think it's because it was taken so level with the subject you can't see that the glass is round, and it feels a bit unsettling.  it fits the challenge though, and i like the reflections in the grill at the base of the shot.  5."

Three of the comments you received summed it up very well, \"Sorry, can't see the relation to the challenge\", \"I would like to see the lines on the album in better focus\", and \"Be careful. People may not understand that\".  The way your image was presented, the \"lines\" were the secondary subject.  By far, the needle and arm are much more prominent and visually, the primary focal point.  If I had voted in this challenge I would have given you a 5 because you met the challenge but your subject choice was weak for the challenge description.

It could be that I'm looking to ascribe some meaning to what I'm seeing, and that any abstract quality is destroyed by some recognizable shapes, or what, for me, amounts to a lack of structure in the composition.  There's a kind of weight to the right edge of the photograph, leaving the rest of it floating in the ether; that may actually be a good thing to some viewers, as it gives a disorienting, weightless impression overall that satisifies some.  Generally I very much enjoy the use of negative space in low-key images like this.  The different shapes made by the intersecting lines are pleasing.  There could be some lighting or post-processing issues to deal with that might result in a higher impact."

  "Great job! An interesting and different subject matter.  Although this handrail could be anywhere, I see no signs of a beach.  However, a water shot, or even a shoreline shot, or anything that might come from a beach, does not always mean 'beach' in my opinion.  And meeting the challenge, to me, is the first and most important thing, if that isn't done, then anything else is unimportant.  Doesn't mean it's not a beautiful and creative shot, because in this case, it absolutely is!  I do love it!  I went back and forth on how to score your pic, but I do vote low for those that I don't think meet the challenge, so to be consistant, I am voting this lower than I want for the reasons stated above."

  "Cute, sweet and innocent. If only the horizon was level.  Would work well also if the horizon was further askew but here it is just in limbo.  People pictures also work better if there is more space in front of the subject than behind - so it looks like they're walking\"into\" the picture and not \"out\" of the picture.

  "BEAUTIFUL. This is wonderful capture and framing is just perfect. I like how the subject fills the frame. B/w is the right choice. I think you dodged and burnt the photo.

  "Again, I would clone out the traffic light.  It really pulls the eye away from the subject of the shot.   Looks like it's hard to get a really good composition of the capital with all that surrounding business area, but it does add a bit of perspective and placment for the building.   I think your colors and tones were better in the closeup."

 "362541.jpg": [
  "While in general a technically good photograph, with pleasing contrasts, nice lighting, and a composition that shows off the leading lines that are the subject here, it's ultimately a prosaic image, which is perhaps why you didn't get the score you'd hoped for.  Add to that the title, and the interest, for me anyway, falls a little flat.  That's not to take away from what is, as I've said, a sound image, compositionally and otherwise.  But, for me, there is nothing to engage.  Perhaps it's a left brain/right brain thing, where some will appreciate the highly structured lines, geometry, etc., and others will be looking for the story behind the image.  As someone has said, a truly great photograph has to be a  of something, while being a  for something else.  Not everyone can do that with every image, but in photographs where we are asked to consider lines, shapes, buildings, and perspective, perhaps it's more called for.  I still want to say that, overall, it's a technically good photo, and many will very much appreciate just that."

The building has great lines and curves and I might have concentrated more or chose an unencumbered area of the architecture and gone with that. From what I can see, the best part might have been where the face was in the mid lower center. I am just imagining the rest of the face on the split levels and curves on a nice angle showing the lines recede up, down or diagonally. Great colors in this as it is but the noise seems to have been noticed a bit."

The opening is ungated during the day but not at night and the columns are still behind the fence regardless of the time of day. I wanted to show, using this angle, as much of the intricacy of this subject as I could without having the fence in the image....just about did it...there is a bit by the lower left corner."

  "Gotta love the intersting lines of a spiral staircase. Overall well done. Some small points... I might have moved the table entirely ouf of this picture, the placement seems to interrupt the general flow of the staircase, and the clutter on the table is distracting. The lamp also creates an unwanted change in the overall lighting in one small spot, so distracts me. The lighting overall seems to be daylight, probably mid day, as it is quite harsh. In the evening using interior lights only might have been better, more warm and moody. The house seems warm so I think accentuating that would have looked quite good."

I'd like to see this photo with some fill in flash. Don't be afraid to use flash outdoors, it will remove harsh shadows under the eyes, nose, lips and chin in mid day sun. It will also help in situations like this, where the sky is bright, but the subject itself looks as though they are in a shadow."

I haven't read the thread you're linking to, not wanting to be biased, but it's hard looking at a photo like this.  This is as real as it gets.  I don't seek out images with this kind of subject matter, so I'm not in the best position to critique it based on it's subject, and it isn't as emotive for me as it will be for others, because neither am I a parent, nor have I had experience with I assume to be a premature infant.  Other than this though, it's a lovely photograph on it's own, well captured and executed.  Congratulations."

  "On the first 15 pictures I see, I'm looking for a full 30 seconds and leaving a comment...the capture is techincally well done.  You capture a nice motion blur while keeping the subject very sharp.  Kudos for that.  The lighting is nicely done in the morning or evening.  The composition is nice, although if I could really change anything I don't like the trees.  They don't appeal to me with their semi-sillouette. 7"
 ],
 "361329.jpg": [
  "I find it difficult to shoot on white and get the whites perfectly white while also keeping the subject well lit.  The flash seems a bit harsh, which ends up blowing out the white dots and making the dominoes on the bottom of the frame too bright, but it also doesn't adequately light the top.  I think you might have had more luck if you'd shot in some kind of softbox.  I have a small table that I use and drape a white sheet over.   Some posterboard underneath that curls up from the bottom along the back, and a desk lamp on either side.  Keeps the light from being too direct and blowing out the highlights, but I can usually get it bright enough if I adjust some camera settings."

  "The conversion to black and white was a good choice for this subject and the evocative image works well and tells a story. Interesting that Pano points out that this would have worked for the perspective challenge. I see that you did enter something similar for that (so congratulations on capitialising on the location) I actually like your perspective entry a little more than this one, perhaps because of your excellent application of toning which adds a little to the shot."

  "This is pretty neat, how did you do that?  The only thing I might suggest would be to use a colored background, I'm not sure what would match and go with the money, but maybe a green, I love how you have the impression of the bill on the ground, but the grayish olive green gives the image a dull feel, though I like your edit much better...  yes, too bad all the challenges weren't advanced  ;)"

 "360709.jpg": [
  "I think the 10 day old chick is an adorable and unique subject for the challenge but at the same time, it probably lowered your score with some voters.  Looking only at the picture, it isn't clear what the central subject, the bird, has to do with the challenge topic.  It's only until you see the title that the connection is made.  Using the title in this way is acceptable by me but it could be a stretch for some viewers who prefer to let the image stand on its own.  In any case, I commend you for thinking outside of the box.",
  "Overall, I think this photo has a good subject and B&W processing that works well to draw attention to it.  However, the blurriness and need for a title to connect it to the challenge probably lowered your final score.  The crop should be a little wider too."

  "No offense but I have never understood what people get out of going to these airshows and taking photographs, the subject just doesnt do anything for me.  Well enough about that.  Photographically speaking, this is not bad at all, just not really all that fond of the composition, not bad really but kindof dull and centered, nothing but dead smack in the middle of the frame.  Then also I always think images that use too fast shutterspeeds at motorraces and airshows make the subjects seem a bit static.  I appreciate the fact that you have a very slight amount of motion blur on the propeller but just not enough for me, wish they were more blurred but at the same time the planes were tack sharp.  Think I saw somewhere that an optimal shutterspeed for propeller airplanes were somewhere between 1/100-1/200?  Anyway, nuff ranting, not a bad shot, just wanted to explain why I couldnt give this more than a 5 wich means average for me."

The blue tones of the sky give us a nice impression of dawn, but the rest of the picture is too murky and muddy.  The flashlight also could have been pointed at the 10 since that is the \"subject\".  Although I'm giving this a 4, I encourage your creative approach.",

The problem as presented is that the tire shows very little detail (Tread, etc.).

First, I wish you would have removed the water bottle from the empty bench before taking this image.  Second, you might want to try cropping this image so that the empty bench is the same distance from the edge as the occupied bench.  This would really help balance this image and remove the red tile distraction on the left side of the photo.  An added benefit to this crop would be the lightest part of the image would be on the far right, which would naturally draw your eyes from the empty bench to the occupied bench and evoke a comparison of the two."

The rider's right foot is under the pedal, trying to bring it forward so he can get started again, instead of on top in the rest position.  Second, the focal point needs to be on the rider's eyes.

The soft focue in the face area actually convey the feeling of motion instead of froozen in time.  I'm sure others will find fault as well with the harsh lighting but since he is wearing sun glasses and there is still lots of detail in his face, I think the lighting is quite effective."

Now that I am revisiting to comment, I can tell you why it doesn't work for me.  First, the sign is an information sign telling you to be careful and maybe even slow down.  Second, nothing about the sign and surroundings say you need to stop or that the person already is stopped and is just starting back up. Since the sign is the main subject of this image it needs to sell the challenge theme and it really doesn't do that very well."

  "Having an object that is always stationary as the main subject for a stationary challenge will not make it a strong entry for many voters.  This image suffers from very flat lighting.  A little bit of work with levels, curves, and saturation would go a long way.  I would have also have like to have seen a little different prospective when you took this, as having the monument dead center makes the image look very average.  Move to the left and get a little lower to the ground.  Stretch your imagination and see what you can come up with."

  "An object that was stationary, stopped being stationary, and is now stationary again.  Can't find a subject that fits the challenge better than that.  You might want to consider cropping a little off the top to remove the sky.  It really doesn't add anything to the image but does try to draw attention away from the main subject.  The image would also be improved if the house colors were a bit stronger and the focus a bit sharper.  Try playing around witih saturation and levels in post processing and USM after resizing and see if that helps any."

  "I like the subject you choose for this challenge very much.  I have a few suggestions you might want to try to improve the strenth of the composition and the overall quality of the image.  First, you may want to remove the boats on the right hand edge and some of the sky by cropping.  The direction of the boats tends to lead my eyes out of the picture and away from the stonger positioned boats.  The top of the sky has very little detail and removing would make the relationship between the dry docked boats and the water stronger.  Second, the waterline and dock make this image appear slanted to the right.  A slight rotation to the left to bring these features horizontal would help the visual impact.  Third, the colors in the sky are a bit washed out.  I think these could be improved using saturation, curves, and levels in post processing."

You might want to consider croping the right side of the image to mirror the crop through the elbow on the left side of the image.  As presented, the negative space on the right gives this image an unbalanced feel.  There are three water related anomalies (air bubbles or components of the main subject breaking through the surface of the water) that distract from the main subject.  One by the hair on the right.  One by her mouth. And one by her right thumb."

  "This looks overexposed and it lacks fine detail. If the lantern was your subject more of the background should have been eliminated. This would best be achieved by getting in closer and finding an angle of view that places the subject against a simple background. In this case you may have been able to find a viewpoint that eliminated the windows, leaving just the stones to add context to the main subject. The biggest problem in terms of composition for me is the strip of blown out sky that can be seen at the top."

 "356671.jpg": [
  "I think the subject is well captured and quite interesting. Getting a chance to look at it, I think the right side of the frame is hurting you...it draws the eyes away, and emphasizes the tilt in the tree. Now this is straight out of camera, so I think it would be nice to see a tighter cropped version, that is straightened."

  "What makes this always stationary object a strong subject for a stationary challenge is the movement caused by the wind in the grass and the tree. The placement of the light house in the center of the composition works well in this image because of the tree.  At first I thought the image could use a little straightening; however, I believe it is an optical illusion caused by the shadows.  Although the person adds perspective to the image, he does provide a distraction, as my eyes keep trying to see a little more detail in him.  Very nice image.",

The DOF also seems to be really shallow, so only some of the petals are in focus. I would actually prefer this type of shot to have deeper DOF so the whole flower is in focus since blurring the background makes no difference because it is black."

 "355958.jpg": [
  "I maybe going against what some may be saying but I know you would want my honest opinion. You had a good idea here but I think it fell a little short. One thing that is distracting to me is the selective desaturation. You have destaturated the green of the leafs but a few around the flowers retained its color. The flowers themselves offer very little detail with dark centers that distracts me. The layout of the your subject in the bulb is leaning all to the right giving me an allusion that the bulb is not symmetrical."

 "355933.jpg": [
  "This isn't really a subject matter that appeals to me, and it makes me think, \"what a waste of rubber.\" However, it is a bit interesting, and looks like something that ought to be hanging in some teen boys bedroom.  I think it could have been improved by cropping out the hairy ankle at the top. I like the blue rim if the tire; it goes well with the light blue smoke.  The focus seems a bit soft.  I'd also like a little more macadam to the left and bottom of the tire."

  "I love the way that you've go the main subject to stand out from the background and I feel that the airbrushing is very well done - it blends with the ground seamlessly. To me, the colour of the sky is a little off and the reflections in the spectacles is a little distracting. Another thing I've just noticed is that the outline of the tree on the left seems to mimic the curve of the top of her hat, adding a framing element.",
  "edit: Just remembered to add, here the subject is looking into the frame which makes all that space much more cohesive.  This in contrast to the cowgirl.  Just imagine here if the subject was looking off to the left, it would make all that space seem unncessary."

The essence of the plant it there but  I'm also reminded of the heads of insects since these flowers tend to take on that appearance ... this subliminally adds a little anxiety to the image -   as does the frozen yet lively water/ice subject matter.  Compositionally it's not bad but I could imagine it more offset to add a more artistic vibe.  A great idea well executed with great colors.  8"

 "354935.jpg": [
  "Nice photo, but it stretches the point so as to be only distantly related. The title helps to connect the subject matter to the challenge, but I find it still an awkward connection; the focus of the challenge is not the type of correspondence, but on the stationery itself. Maybe I'm just overly critical..."

That's not bad, but it also doesn't give us any \"wow\".  The B&W conversion could have been done a bit better I bet.  Look for tutorials (I think we have some here) on B&W conversion techniques.  There is so much more that you could do than Mode>Grayscale."

I like dark images but the lighting here which I assume is ambient just doesn't do anything for me. It lights the subject but nothing more. The part that works the best is on the dress which enhances that flowing aspect. The rest however just looked muddled. Also, the focus seems a bit off. When I look at this my eyes go to the bottom of her dress, which isn't entirely in focus. Maybe the faces are but it's hard to tell due to the lighting."

  "I really like your subject matter and think you captured it well.  But, the image has a few issues.  I don't think all the brown space at the bottom enhances the image.  You could cut out the bottom third, leaving just a bit of the reflection and viewers would fill the rest in in their mind without having to see the blurry sand.  Where the image is cropped on the right is awkward.  Why there?  If you cut so close on the right, your best bet is to also crop close on the left - you are missing balance here and it feels awkward. Anyway, an interesting subject for challenge with a slight tech issue. 7 - good luck in the challenge!"

  "I really like how the tombstones look especially how they fade off. Very eery. I agree with crayon about the face. I'd think about trying longer exposures here. If you're just using flash maybe fire it without your main subject in the shot to get the lighting on the tombstones then while the shutter remains open have your subject move into the shot and do his thing. If this place is pitch black maybe take a flashlight or two and use it to \"paint\" the light on him and if you add some movement to add motion blur you may just get that ghostly look you were after here. Another thing to consider is adding something that makes it \"easier\" for the voters to understand like say flowing white sheets and the like. Voters are like little children who need things explained to them very clearly. This is why they also love bright shiny things like how so many on the front page look like. :) Now you may not always want to cater to that artistically so the question is how mainstream you want to go to appeal to the voters. If you can find that balance your scores will go up."

  "I do like that the subject is not directly in the center of the photo.  That I think was a plus for this image.  Although I'm not sure what was outside the photo on the top, I assume that it was better cropped the way you have cropped it.  However, I think one commenter mentioned the blue color at the bottom as being distracting, and I'm going to have to agree.  With all the negative space at the bottom, my eyes want to see it all one solid color.  The only way it would work, is if the blue tied in with the subject somehow to help enhance it, but I don't feel that the blue adds anything to the photo as is.  At this point, it is just a distraction.  Not sure cropping it out would work though, since then it would be almost panoramic.  So I think the only reasonable solution there would be to reshoot and make sure that blue light wasn't there.  Cover it up maybe?  Put something over top of it?"

It was actually more evident in the thumb than full-sized view.  Good luck in the challenge."

  "While you have captured some of the throwing \"motion\" in the hand, I think the setting might hurt you here.  While McDonald's is certainly a great place to get salt :), the overall setting is a bit distracting from the main subject of the shot.  My personal general rule of thumb is to try and shoot in as simple an atmosphere as possible (i.e. usually one overall color in the background or shot with a tight DOF to blur the background out).  Also, I personally think the shot would have had more impact if we could see the salt actually being thrown (hopefully not right at the camera ;) ) and possibly freeze it in midair with a flash. :)  Great idea though!"

On the other hand, ending the diagonals to the corners of the picture also gives some impact, so maybe crop a tighter to the left and right too."

I'm thinking either you had some problems sizing it for the challenge, or you did a major crop from a larger image...as posted, there is some substantial pixelation going on.  More regarding the subject - I don't think there's really enough \"Motion\" in this shot.  The only \"Blur\" is in the engine prop.  Perhaps a motion panning approach for this may have been a little stronger?",

I wish there was a crisp, stop-action shutter/focus on this subject.  I know, I know, it's about motion.  But the subject is so interesting one wants a good close look-see.",

The shot is only about 9K -- you can submit up to 150K file sizes.  You might want to learn how to better maximize the file before uploading.  That'll give you crisper results!"

  "It's all due to your tilted horizon.  haha, just kidding (but it is slightly tilted).  You know, I like this shot, although I would have called it \"Sidelined\" instead of \"Sidelines\".  That, to me, draws more attention to the subject and his contrast with the players in motion.  The composition is nicely balanced with red on both the right and left.  The boxy white thing in the back is unfortunate, but what can you do about that?  Having an actual soccer ball in the shot would have been a nice touch as well.  I would have certainly given this a 6 and maybe a 7 if I was in a good mood.",
  "This works well with the stationary subject and the moving players.  Enough blur to show motion, but not so much you lose the entire player forms.  Only complaint I have (it's minor) is the position you selected to take this from.  The background left is distracting.  A few steps to your left maybe?  Just a thought.  Good luck in the challenge."

It may have been able to go the abstract or geometric route if you had cropped so that the upper left concrete (which is a nice contrasty color to the rest) took up a perfect quarter of the picture and was squared off.  Otherwise, I think you did about as much as you could with this shot and it was ultimately just the subject choice which limited you."

There are a few which have choosen to follow the method that you have done ... and this works fine.  My side issue is that there seems to be no story behind the shot .. no reason to stand in the middle of the street .. so it is just a little boring (to me that is not to others).",
  "i ike the slightly surrealness of this picture; puts me in mind of \"fight club\" for some reason...  i like that the subject is the blur, rather than the background, which i think is a creative take on the challenge.  it feels wonky though, even though the horizon does look horizontal - i'm not sure what it is (camber in the road surface, illusion of the taller trees on the left?) but it is a distraction.  as is the big street light right above your subject; i think you could have got round this by doing a more wide-screen type crop, like 10mm above and below your subject; not sure this would be 160px though...  like it overall though, both conceptually and in execution. 7."

With advanced editing in your toolbox, it seems that could have been achieved to some degree but you'd be fighting those brightly exposed highlights. Cropping out much of the right side and some of the lower portion appears to be the remaining option.",

  "I can see why you were attracted to this subject for this challenge. The heavily vined tree is intriguing and the bird's house seems strangely out of place and isolated. However, the incredible density of the vines makes for a \"messy\" feel to the photo, and even the birdhouse subject is somewhat hidden behind them. Since the birdhouse is clearly the subject of the photo, you probably should have gotten closer and made more of an attempt to fill the frame with the birdhouse and just allowed enough of the background to give it some context and feeling of desolation, and left out some of the cluttered feel that the tree as a whole gives. It's also disturbing to have to look through the branches to see the bird house itself. Your depth of field is fairly deep, keeping nearly all the branches well focused. It would have been interesting to see a shallower depth, with the background falling softly out of focus. This would made it easier for the eye to find and rest on your intended subject. It's also somewhat awkward that we're looking only at the side of the birdhouse. I can't tell if there's an opening in the front of it or not. Your title suggests abandonment but it's difficult to tell for sure with a side view."

However the photo has some definate focus issues. And the moth seems to almost be blown out with very little detail and clarity. Centering and shooting straight down also seems to take away. Perhaps shooting at an angle and focusing on your subject and then recomposing your photos. Dont be afraid to compliment your photo with some editing, sharpening and adjusting colors, brightness, and contrast. Overall the photo scored about where I would have scored it.

It's a technically excellent shot and has a professional feel to it, both in technical elements and composition. And to me, it does have a feeling of desolation about it. I don't think, however, that it has a sufficient \"wow\" factor to elevate it to the top levels of the typical DPC challenge.

The sky is a problem too, but it's very difficult to tone down a bright sky without the subject going too dark, although the fill-in flash has worked very well here.  Some sharpening will help give the subject some extra impact.  Well done with the composition though."

I know this is a sepia image and you are not going to have true blacks but the low contrast coupled with the highlights probably gave voters the impression that these things weren't technical mistakes and not done on purpose.

My eye starts down the stairs and path...but ends up nowhere in particular. The scenery itself is detailed and too complex to have a point of rest for the eye. The sky is somewhat interesting and contrasty...perhaps if the framing mostly contained the sky? If the clouds, as suggested by your title, were the subject you were aiming for, then a lower point of view that eliminated much of the path and valley might have been the ticket.",
  "Often, setting an image in black and white helps to simplify an image...here it acts as a frustration--I suspect there are lovely hues there, but they've been removed. I think the flowers lining the path and the flowering bush may have provided a fairly suitable subject but they were lost to the B&W conversion."

 "346500.jpg": [

For an image like this to really pop you want to see the color or background lead right up to the model's shadow. The other thing I'd like to mention is the very top right corner.

After looking a bit, I think it's that the man's arm, being darker, stands out most so my eye tends to go back to it, and the true subject fades into lesser focus. I LOVE the idea, though, and the type of processing :)"

I know you don't do sloppy, but that's the impression to the untutored eye and I would have scored it 5 because of it.  I'm also wondering how much more impact there would have been with a little more vertical thirds use.",

This is both a pro and a con, as it makes for an interesting shot that you want to come back to, but a con because the eye does not have anything to rest on. The first thing you look at is the shadow, as that is the dominant part of the image, but the eye tends to drift to the dog because there is more detail to be found there. Then the two parts of the image contend for dominance, making it an uneasy picture.",

I like how the monster's shadow blends into the top of the photo, I like the placement of the subject and the angle from which you shot.

I loved your original but removing the artsy elements like the strokes and the noise in the retake make it look like those were mistakes you are trying to correct. I don't think they were mistakes in the least. Anyway, that's just the impression I get. I know you aren't going to throw the other original away or anything like that. It's just now you have two great images! So congrats on that front."

Seems painfully out of shape with the remaining subject and dark compared, even though the other foot is  light. The spotlight effect works real well but the crop IMO is to tight to justify an empty rooms theme. I'm not saying it does not meat the challenge but what I am saying is you didn't show me enough to get the feel of an empty room. If you could of taken the picture with a wider angle of the room and the spotlight effect on your subject as you have done I feel it would of reduced the front leg issue and opened up the photograph to give me the feel of an empty room. I also wish the title would of said something more about the picture than just the models name.  I feel she has something on her mind as she stares upward. A different title may have given a better picture to viewer relation emotionally."

Certainly thirds can make a big difference to an image by allowing some neutral space into the pic and giving the subject a sort of breathing space.

I would also suggest doing something else with the blue jeans, I feel it takes away from the impact of the eyes being in color as they have more area to consume than the small eyes.  They don't necessarily have to be taken down to black and white but perhaps a more subdued color, maybe just a little less saturated, or perhaps that part converted to a brown or whatever you felt looks good."

I really think you needed a much stronger backlight to make your subject glow around the edges kinda like how the hair is but all over. That would give your subject more presence in the frame as well as give a stronger impression that she is radiating with enlightenment beyond just the flare. However, after reading your setup I'm not sure how you would accomplish that while keeping the spot light you capture in the shot that small.",
  "Really the only issue for me is the subject is just too dark. I think you need to go either full blown silhouette in which case you need more contrast from the background or show more features on the subject using a fill light of some sort.",
  "For me the subject is difficult to make out (I do have a calibrated monitor) and the 'meaning' is unclear.  Some reflectors close to the lens would have thrown light back onto the model and given her more definition. A title something like 'The Inner Light' may have helped voters engage with the image more."

  "Challenge requirements:  this is where I feel it fell short.  The words above the statue are from French Legion and actually mean \"Honor and Fatherland.'  This is a total disconnect from the mood and lyric of the song. The song is indicative of someone going it alone without the help/companionship of another after the break-up of a relationship and the photo indicates something of honor or patriotism in times of battle.  It may have come across stronger without the words in the shot.  Then it would be a solitary person with no outside reference to influence the voters.  The one element of the lyric that is represented well here is individual strength.  But I don't think most voters will go that far...they will take it on first impression from a very short look."

When taking a photograph make sure your subject is more powerful than the environment around him, IMO. Keep up the good work. This may have not been your best work or best score but you have room for improvement and I believe you will. Keep at it because your shot was good. It just need those things that take a picture over the top."

  "My first impression is that the green in this is awesome.  Very much an attention grabber.",
  "Compositionally, because it is an abstract, it obviously does not have a \"traditional\" subject or place to rest the eyes.  It is very busy though, and the eyes go right to left to right following the different waves.  I'm not sure that I am particularly crazy about the tight vertical crop, and wonder what it would be like set on an angle.  That might help to add some interest, as well as another direction of movement because not only would the eyes be following the green lines, they would also be moving diagonally through the frame.  They do that some now, but the centered composition lends itself to being rather static.  So, having a static composition with a busy subject creates tension.  That can be good or bad, depending on what your objective was."

Remember that human eyes are attracted to the brightest part of an image - I don't think you wanted the border to out-compete your subject for attention.  8"

There is nothing wrong with this picture though, just lacks visual impact for me.  Mainly the subject I dont find really all that interesting and I feel like I am just looking at the left part of a complete photograph, like the right half is missing.  Again, I emphasize, nothing wrong with this shot, would have given it a 5 in a challenge."

  "Having the subject dead in the center of the photo works sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't.  This is one of the times where I think it doesn't.  Since there really isn't anything else in the photo to hold our interest but the colors, I think some kind of nice arrangement is a must in order to add some kind of additional visual appeal.",

The subject is wearing a fool's hat and his arms are thrown wide in joyful abandon. The subject and the ground plane are in deep silhouette which is good because it really pops off the warm tones of the sky - not to mention that if any other colors showed it would clash for the eye's attention and 'clutter' the scene. My only critique is that I wish 'the fool' was holding a can and not an umbrella for it just doesn't seem to fit all to well with the time period represented with the fool's hat. Then again, this is representing the Beatles whose songs were sometimes whimsical, silly or avant garde. 10",

Might I suggest either going with a smaller aperture to get more sharp or if the lens allows go with an extremely narrow DOF for artistic effect. What you used here is too \"middle of the road\" and thus doesn't carry the wow factor that either of my suggestions could provide. Also, there is a lot of color here but it's a bit dull. If you are limited with your post processing than try boosting up your saturation settings in camera."

You're certainly going to get hammered for all those auditorium light, though - perhaps unfairly, though your subject has the look of only being lit by one source, my suspicion is that there's at least a little cross light as well as that primary. I joke, really - the look is enough. I think a touch more sense of interaction would add to the image, whihc has a feel of a still thing at the moment, but it's well executed, and good luck with it."

There is no question what the subject is or where the eye should look first--the leading lines of the floor tiles carry the attention directly to the pill bottles and the face of the young woman. The lighting reinforces this concept--the choice of vignetted edges successfully pulls the eye back into the point of interest.",

Perhaps this is because the smoke drifts up to one side leaving some negative space that offers some balance to the composition.  Also, the division of leaves on the bottom, vase, and smoke, gives it that division into thirds that makes it into a stable picture.  The only suggestion I would make is to lower the angle of perspective if possible.  Right now, the viewer is looking down on the subject, and it loses some impact, I think."

  "Almost a beautifully exposed image - well, it may well actually be, but you've allowed so much negative space that the full area of interest of the image is reduced to a very small dimension. There is certainly something to be said for some bretahing-space in the framing of any object, but that raft of black seems unneccesarily much to me - and it has a down-side: with more flower, we'd see more of what gives the impression of being a finely detailed controlled exposure, worthy of a longer look. Also, here, the real eye-catcher of the frame is that brighter, higher contrast part of the bloom, and that is, perhaps, just a touch too centre of frame? Or perhaps even just a more diagonal composition would have sat more happily - I'm just finding that composition a bit discomforting."

  "As a landscape I like this - the great DOF is effective, adding an element of graphic interest as well as simply the view. The contrail in the sky - the vertical one - works slightly clumsily against the effect of the rest of the lines in the shot, perhaps. Fine tonality, though a little judicious shading might have helped emphasise your subject for the DPC voters."

 "339853.jpg": [
  "In my opinion, for maximum impact with a subject like this, depth of field should be inclusive of all elements in the frame, and so the soft bannisters, soft foliage, and soft angular structure at the top of the building all detract for me somewhat.  I think I would have preferred less of the foliage, and more of the structure, so getting right up to the building may have had more of an impact.  However, it could be argued that then your angle would have resulted in the mostly unattractive \"tilting\" effect of shooting up at an architectural structure.  I think because of the number of elements here, the stairs, trees, and building, the result is a tad cluttered, and for me lessens the impact of an otherwise fine photograph."

So, I hope you don't mind, but I may kind of talk in generalizations here, that are applicable to not only this shot, but in general to a lot of your challenge shots. Please keep in mind, this is just my humble opinion, and you may place whatever value you may like on that :-)",
  "I can see by your shots that you have a fine grasp on the technical aspects. Focus is good, exposures are fine, even lighting, dof, basic processing adjustments, etc. What I'd really like to discuss is subject and composition. I feel that concentration in this area could make a considerable difference in your scores. I see from looking through your entries, you have some very cool, creative ideas. This shot, Bulb, and The Emperors Shoes, just as a few examples. There are some though, that do seem to be lacking some excitement and inspiration, so to speak. A lot of times, even mundane seeming things can make for great, interesting images, if presented with a little 'passion' if you will. Some advice that a person gave me once: \"If you want to photograph something, there is a reason why you want to photograph it. What is it about this 'thing' that YOU find appealing. Shape? Color? Texture? Emotion? what? Define that, then find the way to photograph the thing that shows to the viewer what you feel.\"",
  "In a lot of your photos, the idea, the subject is presented in a very straightforward approach. Here is the subject, here is the shot. Ok. We can take for expample, your taxman shot here. A creative, fun concept, but there is lacking excitement, and dynamics. What kind of things could make it different, more interesting? Perhaps in this case, adding a little more context? Instead of haveing the hands cut off in the frame, and seeing just the candies, get more, or all of the model in the shot, wearing a shirt and tie or suit, with an evil, greedy, 'taxman' look on his face :-) Shoot from a more stimulating angle/point of view. Instead of going with even, flat lighting, make use of some dramatic lighting and shadows. Just some ideas here."

But also, the subject matter just isn't very interesting. Everyone sees houses like these in every suburb in every city everywhere in the Western Hemisphere.

The pose looks as if he is praying, the rope makes me think he is a prisoner of some kind, and the flower tells me that his spirit is unbroken.  All together these elements combine to form a very powerful statement.  You mentioned in your notes that you wanted to capture a \"strong image that represents both hope and despair\", well I don't think you truly depict despair.  I believe that this picture shows his spirit triumphing over despair."

There are some elements in the shot that don't contribute anything to the shot, such as the car, the foreground paving, the fencing and the person in the right foreground. All these things contributed to my lower score."

Hence, I believe a deeper DoF is needed to have the building a bit more in focus. The funny thing about reflections is that you must add more DoF to have them in focus (the distance from reflector to what is being reflected is important in your DoF choice)."

I did not vote in this challenge, but probably would have given this a 6 or 7."

Fun image.",

The building you've chosen to photograph doesn't have any interesting features, which is very important in a DPC contest. The sunrise colors are great, but that just doesn't go far enough to saving this photo from boredom.",
  "Good subject for the challenge. The building creates an interesting diagonal and uses up the space well. The only thing that bothers me a little in terms of the composition is the space on top. The way it is now my eyes want to go up and out of the image on the left as oppose to down the diagonal line and into the sunset on the right. I think if you had more space at the top the image would be read more easily from left to right. However the shot is about the architecture and you captured it well."

That is a very effective technique, I believe and makes the composition stronger.  The switch and the little round thing are a bit distracting.  Since this was advanced editing, you could have cloned those out, or you could crop it lower and still maintain your basic overall composition.  I would probably recommend the former more because having a vertical crop gives it a \"deeper\" feeling.",

  "Very nice take on the subject of failure.  You captured a really nice expression that fits well with the title, yet does not rely on the title to meet the challenge.  I would like to see him just a little more inside the frame."
 ],
 "338251.jpg": [
  "There are two immediate and quite large distractions - the big blur of red, and the edge of the mortar board of the next person. A simple (and I think obvious) crop would remove the second - the first is trickier. As far as the crop goes, I really can't see why you've left the image whole - apart from those distractions, you've left your main subject absolutely centred in frame in a quite uncomfortable way, and cutting the left side of the image would produce a nicely balanced composition with arm and face that would be streets more effective."

  "I understand being frustrated by low scores and not enough comments to help you improve, so I'll try to help here. My first impression is that the image is very busy for they eye. There is so much to look at and my eye doesn't find a single obvious point of focus. I think the overall even lighting works well for this type of shot since bright sunlight would create harsh shadows and make the image very contrasty. I'm not absolutely positive, but I'm wondering if the white balance may be off just a little bit in this shot. I see the water is quite blue, and my guess is that white balance was adjusted for a sunny day, and it was maybe cloudy during this shot, so the camera compensated with too much blue (to offset the yellow cast of a sunny day).",
  "It is really hard to tell what your subject is here and where exactly the failure is.  It looks like your shutter speed was low and the shot was handheld, giving the entire photograph some blur.  I do like the flowing composition, but I can't isolate the failure."

Exactly what that would be I don't know, but possibly just to have someone WEARING the jacket so it is \"modeled\", has dimension, maybe a trace of jawline, let the ribbons and badges be the FOCUS of the image but not the WHOLE of the image, you know?"

  "Overexposed and somewhat blurred. Doesn't really fit subject \"success\" that well.",

  "Welcome to DPChallenge :)  I noticed that this is your first submission to the site.  I chose to quote from the comment that 777STAN left on your photo because it shows a situation that is all too common here and quite disturbing at the same time.  I find that most novice photographers believe this statement, and I used to believe it myself.  When a beginning photographer, who takes the hobby seriously, is getting started and learning how to control the camera, technique is more important to them than content.  As you browse the higher scoring photographs on this site, you will see that most of them are usually more about technique than content as well.  Since this site is primarly composed of beginning photographers, it seems that 'eye candy' photographs that are strong with technical merits are the ones that do better than photos that seem to have a very high value in subject content.",
  "During the 5 years I have been experimenting with photography, I have watched people who started about the same time evolve as photographers.  They all started out pursuing technical excellence regardless of subject and content.  As they became proficient with the technical aspects, they began to apply those skills in pursuing meaningful subjects and content :)"

Not super hot red but something that gives even the slightest impression that it's hot. I think if the pavement looked hot so would the egg and so would this image in general and if that was the case this is easily a 6.5 scoring image, IMO.",

If you drag the photo into PS, you see the tone is about a 29 on a range of 0 to 255 (0=black, 255=white).  Use levels and increase the low number to about 30.  This will give the tower a true black (almost) and you can see it looks better."

This is quite a refreshing take on a popular subject."

  "My first impression is that this is very dangerous because what happens if the camera gets wet.  Nice image.  Color seems a little off because normally we tend to think that shower walls are white. But the case could be different for you.  I like the focus and composition.  My attention immediately goes to your eyes and that is where you want someone to start IMO.  The water also has a nice motion blur to it although a little lost in the shower wall at first.  The DOF I think is a little off and your elbow takes away from the photo. I would say either make the DOF so that the elbow was in focus or crop it out.  I think cropping it would hurt it more so my opinion is to try again and put everthing in focus."

Voters also picked up on that I see, by your score, so it was a good choice, if a little brave.  I suspect some voters also gave you lower marks for it as well.. one of those \"art over technicals\" that sometimes gets pulled off for the better. Job well done. I, personally, would have preferred it slightly less exposed, but to each their own.  Focus is dead on though, and the eyes look fantastic."

  "Terrific!  It  the attention of the viewer, not just because it is visually startling, but also because it clearly has something more to say than \"just 'nother pretty girl here\".  It's two distinct pictures; (a) the subject on the right, and (b) the \"other\" person on the left looking at the subject.  It creates the strong impression for me that I am standing beside the person on the left and we are  looking at the subject on the right, as if she were a painting.  It's a strange but pleasant illusion.  I have no clue if that's what you intended, but I sure hope so.  10."

  "Composition -\tComposing a subject like this is very hard especially when you??e taking the photograph yourself. I did notice part of you head cut off just a tad. This kind of throws the composition a little. I would have tried a different angle in order to still be conscious of the photograph as well was getting yourself in the frame completely. Maybe an angle from the top coming down to the ground this would have had you looking more up at the camera rather than straight on. I do like the pose though very intriguing and unique."

This is a good self portrait under those conditions.  Nice DOF, nice focus. The detail in the skin is great. Composition is also good.  The only problem I see with the background is that there are some marks on the wall behind you that makes me wonder what it is and kinda takes my attention away from your subject."

The words look to be in the best focus, with the C being the most crisp.  This part of the photo, to me, isn't the most appealing aspect, so would have preferred the crisp focus to be located in another part of the photo.",
  "I love the blue swirling background.  This is very appealing to look at and adds much visual appeal to the photo overall, however, the main subject is lacking in interest to me.  I realize that the requirement of the challenge was to include a lens cap in the photo, and while this screams creativity, it just doesn't draw me in and hold me there.  The background however, would make a great abstract something or other."

Pretty much the only thing I can say is that I think the composition is a bit cramped for my taste, mainly towards the bottom, you cut off the pepsi machine so closely and I would prefer this shot with just a teeny weeny more space there but otherwise I really dig this shot, nice work."

Ignoring that and considering the photo, it's an interesting subject but could be made more striking by increasing contrast. I'd suggest cropping tighter left, both to remove the extraneous bush and to bring the subject out of center, giving more illusion of flight toward the edge of the frame.  Maybe check out info on the rule of thirds.   Hope this helps :)"

This is not a challenging situation to focus. May be you had shot it handheld in low ligh and get a sort of camera shake. Then a tripod or standing was helped a lot. The light is a matter of taste, its to harsh, revealing to many hot spots and glares. Yes, reflective surfaces are challenging."

  "Compositionally, you've probably done the best job with your chosen subject matter that I can personally think of.  However, the best composition in the world won't make up for content that doesn't resonate with the viewer.  Especially for DPC, your subject doesn't present any of the qualities that makes for a well-scored photo.  No great colors, no strong impact, nothing to really make the viewer stand up and take notice.  The pale colors and the fact that it's \"just a strand of asparagus\" will guarantee that the voters just passed this one by pretty quickly.",
  "This is where I believe you got hit the most.  A still life, as one commenter put it, is generally \"an arranged group of objects\"  I think many people were looking for studio arrangements of multiple objects, and those photos that didn't meet that criteria weren't recieved very well.  I myself don't really have a lot of experience doing or studying still life, but I agree that this photo isn't really \"still life\" as classically defined.  A little more research on the challenge subject before entering can sometimes really help. Especially if you're looking for a higher score."

In the future, it might be good idea to try to close down your aperture a stop or two to get a greater depth of field.

The first thing I notice is that the subject appears slightly blurry.  Doesn't seem to be a focus issue (although hard to tell), just blur.  The subject itself is not that interesting.  No doubt it holds special value to you.  If you were absolutely set on entering this subject, perhaps going for a complementary background may have given it a 'lift'.  You could have also gone for a more creative 'set up' - using the 'Yorkie' as a character in your image."

Fortunately it looks like you only got one sever DNMC vote. kurv's suggestion to title it differently might have mitigated this.",
  "The great strength of this image is it's heavy emotive connotations. The model (yourself, I think) has done an excellent job of conveying the sense of a more than merely physical gap. This could perhaps have been emphasised further by having the seats closer together, and perhaps a glimpse of the forlorn face. I would really like to echo Sachlichkeit's feedback on the general tome of the image - somethign a little darker would have facilitated the mood more. Personally I like the background as it evokes a sense of past experiences shared and memories being relived. In terms of general composition I think this would have worke da little better with the subject closer to the bottom of the frame (but still keeping the textured wood in the frame - maybe a higher point-of-view for the camera would have achieved this."

I would probably have cropped the left side to the beginning of her hair, I think this would balance the image better and give the appearance of more room on the right (the direction she is facing).    I may have also cloned out the little shadow under the nose.  Her hair is really beautiful, would love to have seen a shot without the hair band as the collar on the black coat already gives a dramatic effect to the shot."

The subject and foreground is superb - there is a sense of movement, and action, and power - lovely lines and swirling dust. Would have liked to see more of the workers face - maybe with soem sweat and a grimace, but understand that you couldn't engineer these things. The near-background of the cars, especially the blow-out on the hood is an annoying distraction, and the far-bacvkground is a lto of negative space that doesn't really add value. I think you got a positive reponse from those who dwelt on your foreground and subject."

The title says 'wedding', but I doubt it, given the informal clothing and the way the group is shattered over the place. Furthermore, the group -if it is a group- does not seem to be the main subject of the picture and the blown out whites are pretty disturbing. (3)",

The pose is great, and by that I mean it oozes fun and light-heartedness. You are all arranged in a pleasing manner and I'd imagine this shot would look far better if we could have 720 pixels each way. As mentioned before this is actually a portrait, which in a portrait challenge is a good thing.  As always you will get marked down by the anti-Judi brigade of which there are only a few bitter members. Other than that its a good solid entry, not your best by a long way, but pleasing and fun and nails all the technicals (except that lighting at the front). I predict a solid finish in the top 15, maybe the top 10.",

It's too out of focus, and there is no way because of that for me to tell what this man's expression is like that made you want to convey ths image.

Also, although I'm sure this is a rather difficult subject to get an interesting composition with, I'm not entirely sure I would crop it off like that.

Good luck in the challenge."

This makes the crop in the middle of the leaves also problematic. You might try a crop of this where it focuses on a single leaf. Your DOF on this shot leaves the leaves in the background blurry, but because they also have the strong pattern, they become a distraction rather than an asset."

So if you take away the object in the front the photo would be a poor one. I might not get it though so sorry for my low score.'- Ok, this is a great comment! Very specific info here. It brings into question choices of focus, dof and even again, the composition. If my main subject is the dragon, than this tells me, that viewers are confused about that due to the way that I have presented the image. Maybe I've included elements that are not supportive of the concept of the image. This gives me lots of food for thought to look at and self critique my shot.",
  "'not on topic'- so again, this group is not seeing the S curve. We know that the dragon does have an S curve, so, we have to look at it and think how well did we present that? Is it obvious, or does the viewer have to 'look' a little to see it? Should I have made the subject more prominent? Maybe a different pov or angle could make a difference? Maybe focus choice or dof? Maybe the horse on the glass is over powering and they just didn't notice the dragon? Maybe my choice of subject doesn't 'fit' as well as I thought it did? Or, maybe I just didn't present it strong enough?"

The eye and a bit of the corners of the mouth are in focus, while the beak is not, making it all look quite distorted instead of cute to me.

You silhouette are the threes which, IMO, are not exciting. They do a good job of framing the sky. I feel the color of the sky is not natural and has excessive noise."

The smoke is motionless in this photo but so is every other subject ever captured with a camera so I can't accept that as meeting the still part and since smoke is never still in reality it doesn't convey stillness either. Just my opinion."

My only critique here is that the tones seem a bit cold. Now admittedly that does fit in with the mood you are trying to convey; despair. However, on my monitor I am seeing some warm reddish brown tones in the floor. Bringing out and turning up those tones to a more visible level could help the visual appeal because the warmer tones can add another dimension that would be interesting to the eye. Also by playing around with Brightness/Contrast, Color Balance, Highlight/Midtone/Shadow Adjustment, and perhaps the Gamma Adjustment controls would bring out a more richer, deeper tones to the wood of the Woody for as they appear now the tones are flat and 'cast' in a cold light."

Love the reflections you caught on the two top left windows.",

I like what has happened with the color tinge - I love that nasty insidious green.  But what I'm not crazy about here is the brightness and especially the contrast - it's a little extreme for me, perhaps because I'm looking for dark and grungy.  The other thing may be a side effect of sharpening or overprocessing - it's the jitters on what should be straight lines. Did you do anything besides run the UA?"

(honest, my first reaction :))  This portrait holds a lot of interest for me, but I can't shake the feeling that this is just a tad *too* dark for me to really love it.  Now I like other really dark shots, so what is it about this one I don't like?    Could be just simple subject matter - I want to see all the lines of his face, but much of the details are disappeared here.  I really don't know - I'm a bit on the fence with this one."

The costume is great, and I really like the light blowing out her face slightly. I happen to like the PS filters, when applied artistically, but I don't think the average DPC voters do. Anyway, I like this one better than your entry, which was good too."

The subject and motion are vertical so, in this frame, the water begins from nowhere and flows into the bottom of the frame. The flow is also broken by the rock at the base of the first \"landing\"...Follow the water down, then stop, look left, continue...see? Broken.",

Anyway, love how the white of your main subject realllllly pops off the deep black backdrop. Your composition just pops visually and the illusion you present to us in the composition holds the viewer's attention as we scratch our heads and think \"now how did he/she do that?!\":-) Lighting and level of details are great in this one. Love how you added a slightly different touch with the pencil being the the same blue tone of the push pin. Visually the color is appealing not to mention it too pops off the white backdrop it rests on."

It's hard to pin down the angles of the rocks or the overall scale when looked at in detail, only by pulling back does the lay of the land make itself apparent, but by then it's impossible to process all that info at once, so instead of seeing the image as a meaningful environment, there's only an impression of the shape.",

It's clear what the scene is - an individual under a beautiful umbrella walking through a park/ trees.

  "Nice post production and the subject matter is very much in tune with the impressionists, however I suspect a higher saturation of the sky would have improved it. The horizon running through the central axis along with the heads of the closest two anglers makes for a less than interesting composition. Change the camera angle and I think you would have a really good work."

Minor nitpik is the floor/wall seam in the upper-left.  A minor tweak in contrast and curves could make this jump out a little more."

My own opinion and the reason they never made it out of lightroom - they just look so damned boring.  No colors and they are very difficult to make out detail on as they are so pale."

  "you're on the right track with this, just some things to keep in mind.  there are two types of action shots:  general action, and player specific.  with player specific shots, you really need to try to isolate the player; here, that would mean getting the 2B out of the background.  also, crop tighter, either in-camera or in pp (and in pp, go on and straighten your horizons).  lastly, you need the shot just before this one, while his leading foot is still in the air ;-)"

I think this would be fascinating if the subject onion were not grainy - if it were processed to look silky smooth against the grainy onions. Just a thought. This is a cool photo."
 ],
 "582177.jpg": [
  "I personally like the negative space you currently have.  I think it would look good if you cropped close so the subject filled the frame.  If you just cropped it on the right and left the negative space on top might look interesting.  Or just crop a little more from the right so you don't have as much negative space.  What it really comes down to is whether you like it.  Sorry if I wasn't much help."

 ],
 "582164.jpg": [
  "First, I think the subject is lovely and the lighting is just about perfect. The use of green bokeh in the b/g is excellent as it provides a metaphorical foil to the dying rose.",
  "Although the rose appears initially to be in a nice position compositionally, I felt something was slightly off balance while voting. I think it's because the real subject (in my eye at least) is the center of the rose. The center is high and near the center - which gives a feeling of needing a bit more room on the top and less on the bottom. The rose also has a bit of a rigid vertical feel to it - if it were tilted slightly with the stem disappearing to the bottom left corner I think the line would lead nicely to the subject. Finally, I think that the whitish petals on the right side of the rose detract from the subject.  The eye tends to always be drawn to the brightest part of a photo, and in this case it's those two petals."

The crop cuts off just a peice of the bench, would like to see either more of the bench cut off or have it entirely visible. Can barely make out the drink and seems placed unnaturally."

  "My first impression of the image was that it was out of focus. It's not ; but the arm of the closest pew is out of focus, and since it's a large and dominates much of the shot, it kind of messed up my whole initial reaction of the photo. Either cropping that first pew arm out might have helped, or if possible, a less shallow depth of field would have fixed that while you actually taking the photo."

You couldn't have opened the aperture on this lens more than f/8--even if you could you'd be fighting to keep important elements in the blossom sharp because of the depth of the flower. So, with the equipment at hand it seems the background needed adjusting. More separation between flower and background--a different bloom, a different angle toward a portion of the foliage farther away? Or, as mentioned before, a more dimly lit background--perhaps having your \"beautiful assistant\" shade it.",

The strong point of the image lies in the patterns of the ground, created by the play of light and shadows of the tree trunks and the dark trees themselves.

Lighting is nice, but it doesn't really exploit the curves in these objects nor emphasize the texture on their surface."

  "First off, what is immediately noticed is that the harshness of the black lines really contrasts with the softness of the subject - which on its own is an interesting effect for the sake of noting different effects.",
  "The effect on this photo, however, strongly pulls the viewer away from the concept of photography and into the realm of digital art (similar to - but to a much greater degree - than the two photos you have posted in your response, below) due to the fact that the subject is a portrait of a child. The fact that the chosen subject is emblematic of purity and innocence causes the contrast set up in the post-processing effect to be amplified to the point where the mind has difficulty merging the ideas of \"child\" with this unusual and stark technique. Metaphorically, you are asking the viewer to swallow sugar with equal amounts of salt."
 ],
 "579859.jpg": [
  "The tones in this image work exceedingly well with both the subject and the manner in which you executed the photo.  I do find the lower right portion of the photo to be a bit of a drawback, as the presence of a large glaring white spot in the overall scene is extremely jarring."

  "First off I love the mood you are trying to capture here. A sweet and enduring moment between mother & daughters in a picnic perfect setting. The white dresses capture the idea of innocence and sweetness - The whole setting and your subject remind me of Gay Talbot's Tea Party painting. This is a good picture but there are several things that would improve visual appeal and place this in the above average or even exceptional category. The teapot & teacups get lost in the ruffle of the dresses. Placing them slightly higher on a small kids table would give them equal share of the themed spotlight. Next the mother's hand obscures the gesture of giving or receiving tea to/from her daughters. Making that gesture visible to the viewer is highly  important for it adds human interest, visual appeal, and a way for the viewer to connect emotionally with the scene presented. By simply having the mother give/receive tea/teacup with her other hand it would make that gesture visible. All subject's have a look of concentration on their faces but none has a smile that would give us a visual cue that they are having fun. A single smile can show joy and offer another connection for the viewer to connect to the image. It took me a few seconds to figure out what the I was seeing in the foreground. A little dog sits there but he/she is very hard to see because the dog is underexposed so that one really cannot make out details on it's face. Flash fill would expose the dog correctly so that we see the details more clearly but you would have to be careful that you don't overexpose the details of your main models in the white dresses which can reflect the light back. This is just my opinion but I think the addition of the little dog does not add much to the scene. Introducing too many subjects in your photo composition can either weaken or strengthen the composition. The center stage belongs to the mother & daughters having a tea party. Adding the cute little dog I think takes some attention away from your main subjects. Lastly I think that desaturation takes away from the appeal of the photo. Desat or B/W or sepia done right can add a sense of nostalgia and times long gone. But I think that keeping the colors of rich greens against the downy white tones of the dresses would really help add to visual appeal. It would invoke/strenthen the idea of a picnic type setting for this lovely little tea party."

Upon opening the image, my first impression was that the eye is most likely diseased -- the opposite of attractive or desirable. Even with your explanation, the globe takes a fair amount of work to perceive. The idea of substituting a \"world\" image into an eye might be worth futher attempts (clever idea), but I suspect that even a crisp version would clash with what we expect to see in an eye and would be a serious subliminal negative."

  "Nice capture of this doe! I like the detail in that we can see (almost feel really) the downy softness of her fur. The two things that I would suggest to improve this image is that the contrasts and saturation seems a bit flat. Bumping up the contrast or even playing around with the shadow/hightlights/midtone levels would help the subject pop visually. As for the saturation it looks a little washed out - bumping up the saturation bias & strength would help deepen and enrich the hues without over saturating the image. Another way to do this in-camera as you are taking the picture is to play with a higher aperature setting (5.6 or 6) and a shutter speed of ohh 1/200 to 1/1000 to offset the bright afternoon sun that may wash out the contrasts and saturation in exposures (you may really have to play around with the setting before settling on what would be best the next time an encounter like this presents itself to you)."

  "Hi David, the silkiness of the water is really good though I'm getting the  impression the whole image is somewhat blurry. This may be intentional or a consequence of unintended shake.  As the camera is already on a tripod (it is on a tripod?), consider triggering the shutter with a timer or with a remote shutter activation device suited for your camera.  These are cheap on eBay and will eliminate the shake you get when activating with your finger. If this is not the issue, weigh down your tripod by suspending some weight directly below the center of gravity as this will reduce the effect wind has during longer exposures. Otherwise, the colors are very gentle though appearing a bit \"magenta\" at my end.  Hope that helps and thanks for the inquiry. Getting closer!"

But it is only an attempt: the photo itself is not so easily  pigeon-holed. Though I will grant you that it is a rather effective interpretation. I do indeed sense depth in your photo, whereas I perceive motion in JPR's. Perhaps that is what you were getting at when you asked for a comparison. Yours is indeed a hole, while his is a tornado: two different but equally valid vehicles of transformation. What interests me about your photo is that it feels like I can almost make out the subjects, but as I do I go deeper into the \"hole.\" It is as though you are representing the very process of looking. To some degree, I think most great photos do this, but that's a whole nuther can of worms."

I don't like her pose because it makes her upper arm look really really big. If you could just have her hold her arms out slightly from her body (perhaps have her raise the bouquet so her hands are right at her belly button) and have her turn just 15 degrees more towards the camera. Her hair and headpiece are lovely and show well here. Try to have your subject tilt their head juuuuuust slightly one side or the other to bring the eyes on to different plains :)  whew!

  "How can an image be musical? One way is blur, because music occurs in the blur of one note into another. Music, after all, requires time: time for the notes to play, time for them to change, time for the pulse of rhythm. Blur suggests time, since it suggests motion. Your subject matter and composition continue this theme of motion over time. We have the child, blurred, from moving, living and, one subliminally feels, from growing. Add to that the highlight to his right follows lines of perspective and motion is once again implied, motion from background to foreground, or vice versa. And over (under?) all this is the rhythm of the texture of the repeating curves of flora."

  "This is an excellent character portrait for sure :)  I love photographing people much in the way you have done here, and early in my decision to pursue that avenue, I had to deal with the issue of photographer 'fear' of people.  It seems to me that most photographers I know are too afraid or shy to speak with a stranger and simply ask them if you may make a few photos.  Most seem to want to take that candid stealth route.  For the last several years, I have been working on a \"1000 Faces\" series of photographs.  I'm a long way from finishing it, but each person in the series is someone I have interacted with in one way or another.  Some are candid and some are impromptu portraits on location.  But each of them are of a person who I have had some amount of verbal dialogue with... there are even a few celebrities.  It really is amazing how you can briefly get to know someone and maybe even learn something by simply talking to them.  I most often find my subject and start a conversation before I ask for the photographs and I'm rarely turned down.",

Had the background been missing the car and building (next time see if you can get them torn down before you shoot) and we had just been left with the dog and his owner the image could have been much stronger. AS is though the man kind of blends in in a not so good way with the vehicles and the lines from the blur on the building end up distracting. The first image works well as a blurry image because it benefits from all the aspects (lines, colors, flow, contrast) working together to provide a somewhat cohesive subject. This second image just feels more like a quick snapshot that was taken out of focus. (from the blurgeois thread)"

I think taking the idea of an upside down theme and making the subject apear rightside up though he is upside down is great. My suggestions (and please do reshoot this photo) would be to better frame that wall on the left that has the outlet. I think if you could manage to have that completely out of frame that would help. Also the floor/cieling would be better as a 1 piece and no sheet off to the side. And finally a little more editing with either iphoto or picassa could make the contrast and colors really stand out and take it from a picture to a photograph without getting too advanced. The upside down to right side up photograph hanging on the wall is a great touch however. I really think you could make this a great picture, so please try again."

  "I love the expressions and the action going on here in this underwater shot. Shooting underwater has got to have many challenges to overcome to get a good picture I would think. You captured the joyful mood and emotion hands down. But, as much as I like the action, the sharp details of the models, their facial expressions and body pose I still think there is room to improve this image. First, the shadows cast at the bottom of the pool distract from the models I would have liked to see them free floating in the watery space for twofold reasons. Having them hang in space give the impression of weightlessness and fluid motion as they take the plunge. Second, there would be no distracting shadow to take attention away from the action going on or the models. Next the contrast seems a bit flat mayhap that is from the water reflections, the exposure or both. Bumping up the contrast levels or highlight/shadows would make this pop visually a bit more. I have been debating whether to suggest if this would look better in B&W as opposed to color. The advantage of the B&W is that if the conversion is done right is that the tones, textures and main subjects would visually pop off from their watery green-blue environment/background. The disadvantage is that it might not be readily recognizable as an underwater scene. Still a very good action and emotive scene - bumping up to a 7."

I find it much more pleasant when you let the white area around leaves such as this peacefully bleed over to the leaves and potato, not be so sharp.  Also when you whiten a backround like this, the subject always seems more contrasty than it did before whitening the backround so when I do this, totally blow out the whites, I usually set the contrast afterwards as I dont want to over do it."

  "One of the possibilities for blur is to convert it to noise. This can give your photo the appearance of grainy film. It is similar to  's strategy above -- make your photo look like something else -- though this is less elaborate. Personally, I love the film grain look. It gives a photo like this a documentary feeling, a spying, voyeuristic sort of feeling, that adds excitement to the shot. This works well with the closeup and the head protruding from some sort of enclosure/boundary. There's just a general feeling of confrontation, of the voyeur getting caught, that adds interest for the viewer."

Also, possibly if the spider filled the frame, it might have been easier to appreciate the detail. You might have to move closer to the subject to pull this off - zooming in in an editing program may make the softness worse. Another approach might be to reduce the zoom and show the spider hanging from a web thread and located according to the rule of thirds. The simple background certainly emphasizes the subject. I wonder if a nice bokeh background might have increased the interest level of the photo. Good luck in future challenges."

  "The boy under the tree looks stoned or bored.  If the subject is uninterested the picture becomes uninteresting. The bright light on his face may have something to do with him squinting so much.

  "Once the subject was discovered I wondered what you were trying to say. It is about death and decay. It's an unusual find. It reminds me of those French cave paintings in its pose and earthy tones but doesn't quite have the same graphic qualities (those are more apparent in the high-contrast version). Nonetheless, I'm seeing something new to me. I've seen plenty of road-kill, mostly bloated does with their tongues sticking out beside the road. Here a younger deer relatively uneaten by scavengers with clearly recognizable hoofs and head.",
  "I like the sepia toning. I think it does what you intended emphasizing the relation of animal and earth. But I don't think the blur effect works toward helping the viewer understand the subject better. The composition feels off to me. I would like to see the rest of the front leg and perhaps a slightly different angle on the subject. Perhaps if the image had been taken a step to the right the head would be better defined and the focus would not be on the rise of the belly where my attention is continuously drawn because that's where the contrast and sharpness are placed.",
  "I hope you don't mind this unusual \"critique\" of your image. I believe that no subject should be \"off-limits\" in poetry or art but the artist doesn't always know what they're saying until it is received by the listener. I hope you'll keep pushing the limits and create more provocative work. Keep shooting!"

The red boat at the front is half obscured by the quay, the other boats are receding in a line, the buildings are somewhat distant, and the leading line of the quay does not give any guidance.  So I think that your composition fails to tell any story."

Excellent focus, and shallow DOF at this range make this a very pleasing image.  I reach for my Micro Nikkor 55 manual focus when things seem to be getting dull, and the boredom is always gone in just a few minutes.  It always impresses me that the lens can see things that I certainly can't with my eyes, like the little hook claws on the ends of the bee's legs."

  "Getting a natural looking smile out of a portrait subject can be challenge enough, but seems particularly admirable when the subject is also the photographer, simultaneously busy worrying about all the technical aspects. I wouldn't have guessed this to be a self-portrait without being told. This image flatters you much more than the B&W one from January, partly because you hair and eyes do very well in color. The straight-on pose and your narrow chin provide no clues about being \"heavy\". Maybe you are too self-critical in the comment about \"bloodshot\" eyes. To me, they look natural and serve to enhance the impression of seeing a genuine person -- much more attractive than if artifically manipulated into a plastic non-reality."

  "I can appreciate the difficulty of getting a good angle to capture the subject at a busy venue like this. Nonetheless, the photographer somehow has to overcome the obstacles to capture the intended subject. I think there are several things getting in the way of your success.",
  "Overcoming distance: A long lens would help a lot to close in on the subject and provide the chance for a narrower depth of field in this case. Barring that, shooting to crop is another option. I'd try to wait until the subject had a plainer background behind him...the fence would be an improvement over the people seated behind him in this image. Then, the image could be tightly cropped to further define the subject."

If about the landscape and a person's involvement with it, then the connection is tenuous...the subject aloof. If it's primarily about the landscape then the figure of the person is too prominent an only seems to obscure the setting."

  "However, as some of your commentators have mentioned, the image seems to lack the ability to sustain interest...there's little beyond the first impression to compel further engagement with the subject. It's difficult for me to see the \"story\" in the image. Is he someone who wanders the pier and chats up women or just a blustery uncle with whom the women are losing patience? There are reactions from the women just nothing strong enough to fill out the story, in my opinion.",

Into my favourites so that I can find it whenever I want!",

  "The subject you chose to represent \"triumph\" fits the challenge fairly well. However, I agree with some of the comments you received that it is mostly a representation of someone else's idea--in this case, the sculptor and the photographer on whose work the sculpture was based. It's good to try to bring your own interpretation to the subject, even if it has as its subject a sculpture (or other piece of artwork). Viewers want to see your own interpretation of it, something new. A few other mentioned including fireworks or a sunset...including unique elements like those can make your photo stand out."

The large area behind the subject without any detail is somewhat disconcerting at first, and I find myself wondering if you did that on purpose, although it would appear not.

Typically with a still life you can control all of those distractions by moving the flower around.  Speaking of which I'm sure some are voting low because they feel this doesn't meet the qualifications of a still life.

  "Let me start off by expressing my sympathy for the loss of your friend.  You choose a very tough subject to sell in a challenge at DPC.  Suicide makes people uncomfortable, as well it should.  Regarding your image, I think you did a great job communicating your message.  There is no emotion more extreme than taking your own life.  Reading through the comments you received, I see that people were split between liking the B&W and wishing it was in color.  I think the choice of B&W was a good one and served the image well.  I think you might have scored a little better with a different conversion method to make it B&W.  I prefer the channel mixing method explained in the DPC tutorial by fotomann_forever.  This method would give you the option of adjusting between the red, green, and blue channel to make the blood show up better and to provide better contrast in the rest of the image.  The more you boost the red channel above than the green and blue, the more the blood will lighten up.  Give it a read and play around a bit."

  "First let me congratulate you on a very score in this challenge.  I know you were probably hoping for a 6+ but your scorer indicates that the image was technically strong and meet the challenge description well.  My only suggestion for improving the image you set up would be to put a little more separation between the cup, flower, and glasses.  Each object on their own could have been the main subject but with the shallow depth of focus you used, the flower and glasses became nice secondary subjects.  However, by placing them somewhat behind the cup, they also act as distractions to the composition.  You've done very well here at DPC in the short time you have been a member and I expect to see you in the top 10 of a challenge very soon."

All in all its pretty well done technically.  I would probably have used something else than water in that glass, probably white wine and waited till it was not so misty, I think that mist on the glass is not really to my taste.  If you wanted to give off the impression that the water is Ice cold, I would rather have suggested you just put an ice cube in the glass and water droplets on the outside, that would have done the job more pleasing to at least my eye.",
  "I like the classic still life shot. The subject matter, lighting and focus are all good. The composition is OK everything is well placed except the glass. It may have been better IMO to have place the glass behind the apples and next to the strawberries - effectively where it is but further back. I think that the eye is distracted by the glass and by placing further into the shot the strawberries would stand out more and the eye would be looking at a pyramid of subject matter."

I am not sure b/w was the way to go here, I do like the b/w conversion, its got great tones in it and looks cool but I just get this impression that the colors in this shot would have made it pop a bit more.  Most of all, the hat and overall would have looked nicer in color I am sure, but the backround was maybe too prominent in color so thats why you chose to make it b/w?  Anyway, not sure it would be better, its just the impression I got."

  "A reaction (since you asked in the reaction club): Something about this made me feel sad, almost profoundly so. Some of it was the subject matter, something that obviously once held memories for someone, something important enough to shoot on slide, yet now gone, forever, unrecoverable, lost. The way the damage appears, especially in the film and the left slide, increased the strength of that reaction in me. The use of the plants and the drawing brought me back a bit, making me feel the slides were not so lost; why give preference to the originally captured image? Just because it had the luck of being first in time? Maybe this is how these slides should be used, not holding some out of focus image of a model on a car hood or darkness because the photographer had his finger over the lens, but interacting with life and beauty and making art. There was still something, though, that pushed me back toward sadness, and until I read the comments, I didn't realize that it was the space in the lower left corner. Compositionally this works for me, great lines and flow. But given the subject matter and its arrangement, the lower left space  adds to the feeling of sadness for me. There's just something . . ."

What you need to do to really do well in challenges here is simply to blow the socks off the voters and make your image memorable or connect to them in some way.  Best way to do that is for starters have the subject look at you when you are shooting a portrait and try to have the photo as simple as possible, focus on eyes, no distracting objects like the paper or the chair in the backround."

It's a bit over-brightened.  This would have done much better in a challenge titled \"Sticking out\" or \"Danger\" for example.  You've got great depth of field and creative shooting angle.  Keep at it.  I've gotten in the bottom few twice out of the dozen or so entries I've submitted."

It's an effective portrait, it tells me a little about the subject. My final impression after looking at it for a while is that you've got a great portrait here, and there's not really anything I'd change. I have a feeling it won't do too well as far as votes go, though, which is a shame."

  "By choosing a horse as your subject you are making a clever pun on the word nightmare.  The choice of b&w (or duo-tone? - a bit hazy on the technicalities here) is good to illustrate nightmares as it somehow separates the scene out from reality (although there is a dichotomy here as this clearly IS reality..).  The photo is well composed, adhering to the rule of thirds whilst maintaining a sparseness that concentrates the viewers mind on the pain and seeming never-ending discomfort that the horse is experiencing.  The photo lacks 'punch', which is a problem with it as a stand-alone photograph, but actually in terms of the challenge is apt, as from my experience the visual elements of dreams and nightmares lac the clarity of reality."

  "This is actually very cool. You've got the yin yang for dichotomy but you've also put humor into the title by using the subject (egg) to form the idea of segregation where you've separated the yolk from the white. There's so much to think about in this one. Way cool. And the technicals are very good as well making this a well rounded (no pun intended) shot for this challenge. 10"

Photographically, it's a good photo - I believe it's a bad choice of subject matter. I'm sure others will have similar opinions but most will probably think it's funny. The title?

The laws are slowing changing to favor the landlords: new apartments are never subject to rent regulation, while the old apartments that are stabilized are becoming a thing of the past.  Once a certain monthly rent is reached on an apartment, it is automatically removed from rent stabilization restrictions.  So with each new lease, the landlord can raise the rent to \"market value\" or whatever he feels he can get."

Still, it's a nice shot."

Composition-wise, having the subject off-centre is a great choice, but your background doesn't do you any favours - it is too close for you to play with DOF so we're just left with some out-of-focus brown rocks which for me are a bit of a distraction; not that you had any power over this.

I found Waldo fairly quickly, but that's not my test for this challenge (I'm actually looking for interesting images). Part of what I like here is the general emptiness you captured without making it feel cold. It's waiting, anticipating, not lonely. Nice, I give it an 8."

First, there really isn't a main subject to help anchor this image besides the color.  As the viewer's eyes move around the image there is nothing that holds their attention for any length of time.  Second, there are so many layers to this image, the flowers, the box, and the window, that it looks cluttered.  Another byproduct of not having a main subject in the composition."

Yes, it meets the challenge, because you have singled out your subject by colour, but there's nothing else except that, not even focus, no fancy composition, no school work (I don't understand how song lyrics are related to school work).

To me, the subject would be either the overall landscape as a whole, or the clouds. And if that is the case, then the negative space would be the airport, which really doesn't have any \"wow\" at all. The colors in the clouds are nice, but the airport is extremely underexposed. Perhaps the use of an ND grad filter would benefit this shot. Then you could have had a brighter foreground and still maintained the stormy look in the clouds."

At least that's how I interpret it. If you had some subject in this shot with the sky as the bg then it might fit the challenge better imo. If you intend the tree to be the subject and the sky the bg then it works for the challenge but for me the brown line to the left of the bench and the white building? between the trees above the bench sort of detract from the shot. It is a pretty sky and the shot isn't bad. It just doesn't stand out as one of the better images to me. 5"

My comment for you though as for a few others in this challenge is that your title indicates the sunset as your subject and the challenge is for negative space to add the wow factor to your subject. If your subject were say a small boat in the foreground (without the bushes) then your bg/negative space would be the sunset and then it works but as your title indicates the sunset IS your subject therefore where's the neg space? I still think you have a nice shot here so it gets a 5."

The image provokes in me a sense of...I can't really articulate it, a sort of sense of 'being' - it somehow depicts a whole bundle of very personal emotions.  I guess what I am saying is that an abstract image such as this is what it is perceived as to it's creator and to each viewer; each will take from it something completely different and governed by their own experiences and psychology.  For me, it works extremely well."

Your shote is panned fairly well, but I think that the big problem with your image is the subject matter.  BMX/freestyle is a great subject, but timing plays a huge part in creating a memorable shot.  When a person is shooting an action sport, the goal is (usually) to capture the participant at the peak of action. The rider in your shot is riding up the transition, he's preparing to jump into the air (or do a grind) which would make a much more interesting photo than what he is doing in this shot.  That's just my quick two cents on your shot, if you have any more questions, feel free to PM me."

As for the composition, it's OK but a bit on the static side.  The \"rule of thirds\" bit does indeed play into landscapes a lot.  One of the \"rules\" (which of course can be broken if your subject suits) is to NOT split the picture in half horizontally for landscapes.  You do have some foreground interest - that's good.  But try to figure whether you want to emphasize your foreground or your sky - which suits the shot best? - then compose with more of that element.  Not sure what the lighting/color situation was in real life, but to me the sky seems an unnatural shade of pink/red."

I'm not sure if it is because adults don't connect with toys in general or what, though I suspect it is more a case of having higher expectations -- if you are shooting toys you have control over everything in the shot, therefore it needs to be perfect and/or very dramatic.  Don't know if that was the case here, though I suspect it may be."

My opinion is that the addition of the beads would ideally add to the interest of the photo, as a subject of interest.  If this is the case, I think a bit sharper focus (or is it in the PP?) would serve them well- if not, I do think they draw attention and might be pulling attention away from the female form.  I do agree with your comments regarding the position- perhaps a bit further to the right in the image might be better.  Other than that, the only thing I notice is that the bright light in the center of the subject's chest draws a lot of attention- whether this was your intention or not is entirely up to your artistic preference, but I do find myself looking more towards the large space between the bottom three and top two rungs of beads."

As for the photograph - yep, she definitely looks stoned!  I like the composition, especially with the OOF girl behind with the cards.  Makes me wonder what the game is, and whether or not she has a good hand (she looks like she does).  Perhaps a little snap-shot'ish, but I think snapshots are a valid form of photography.

From the higher angle, it looks like she is looking down on the flowers which is nice; however, the angle itself is rather stale.  Higher might give it more of a dramatic feeling, or lower to show more of the detail of its face.   If you really like this angle, I think zooming in and cropping it very very close."

  "For a portrait with drama (which I see here) I wouldn't have the subject so centered.  The negative space would be fine if on one side or the other.  Black all around the subject makes here look smaller or farther away from us the viewer.  For effect get in closer and have your subject to the left or right of the frame leaving some of the negative space."

There's a visible light source, but then there's these really harsh shadows which are clearly coming from a spot light off-camera. If you still have this set up available to you, I'd be really interested to see what it'd look like using just the light from the candle and a longer exposure time. I think it might really bring out some of the interesting textures on the typewriter and leather cover which are being lost to shadow or washed out from the harsh light."

Although vibrant with colour, they appear to have a matte finish. One good trick I have used is to wipe them with an oil (probably Olive oil)and they become much more reflective. You could at that stage also spray them with water to give them that just picked look."

The music with the roses - or - music sheets with the violin.  The music stand center leg is also a distraction.  Last thing...the violin is substantially OOF."

 "792046.jpg": [
  "In terms of the message, hmm, not sure what to make of it... So for a start, the word \"still\" makes the message seem somehow very defensive rather than positive, in a \"you all think I screwed up my life, but actually...\" kinda way. If you want to go with the general message you've got at the moment, I'd maybe rephrase it with something like \"19. A mother with a dream.\" or something. However, what I'd really like to see you do is think through exactly what it is you're trying to promote. I'm guessing it's not just a general \"yay, teen pregnancy is good\"? The UK has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe, it's a huge negative social issue where I'm from... On the other hand, because of the amount of negative stigma surrounding it, it's actually really nice to see a positive image saying that a teenage mother can be making a valid choice, be a good parent and love her child, and that the bad stigma is unjustified. Is that what you're trying to say? I think I'm missing the social/cultural context to understand it properly - could you explain what it is you're trying to convey?"

  "good DOF and clearness of the main subject",
  "On the other side of things, I've never really liked the flash on subject at night look just because the it never lights the entire image. But on the same note you didn't blow out any highlights with the flash so the amount of flash used to illuminate the subject is spot on. It also looks like you might have over sharpened this image too much, I guess to give it a more grungy look. Over all I give this shot a 7."
 ],
 "791817.jpg": [
  "The line through the glass, and onto the ring/hand is very nice. The attention to detail is noted. However, it doesn't strike me as a particularly compelling image. Things seem a bit underexposed, there isn't a whole lot going on in the scene, and things aren't all in focus. Consider using a hyperfocal setting. Really, though, it boils down to subject matter. While your photo makes me think of fidelity, marriage, anniversary, the topic is glamour, and a snigle ring does not compel that from me."

A tad on the uninteresting side for my liking... there's not enough here to keep me looking.  Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty scene, there's just no real subject that grabs the viewer.  Colours are good, though I think I see a hint of pink in some of the clouds... I do like your tag line though, well and truly fitting for the challenge.

  "While the image is perfectly level, the impression of it being off level and  a trapazoid is very strong. While this may, or may not, be an issue to some viewers, it certainly makes the image more interesting. A very simple construction to this composition is impressive and the sense of distance in the back ground wall is rather startling. Pleasing and complimentary colors, simple and effective subject matter, this should score fairly high."

  "Interesting image. The old and the really old. The wide angle effect to the out-of-focus area at the top is a bit uncomfortable to look at, and the result is that my eye often returns to the subject of the portrait. I'm intrigued that an image has made me \"feel\" that way. In that regard, you've accomplished more than creating an image."

In this sense, the title and subject, while fairly common in several recent challenges, perfectly fits the challenge subject of darkness and is a inventive way to look at same. Normally, this reviewer has issues with over use of space, but, no pun intended, the space in this image is well used and very effective. Originally rated an 8, it has been rerated to a 9 for technical excellance if not artistic impression."

  "First what is really an afterthought - a very good title that may have been misunderstood by the general viewer - it could be viewed as too clever by half crepuscular being a term used by almost exclusively emtomologists. :>) That being said, the title exactly matches the subject and is a very good macro shot in difficult lighting conditions. The vaguely detailed background is a perfect compliment to the subject and the entire image is very effective. Well done."

  "Dogs and fire places are a natural candid subject as they both fit together like honey and fresh bread.

It's a little to \"in your face\" and obvious. The baby's left arm in yellow from photoshop manuipulation. You need to go over that spot with a black brush to fix it.

  "A good entry into the challenge, it lacks any significant point of interest to recommend a higher rating. The over use of shadow for effect is largely ineffective - a little more detail in the dark areas would have been a huge plus. The ship heading toward harbor is a good detail, but with no running lights, it fails to give an impression of dusk, evening or night and, in truth, the whole image just appears flat. While there are hints of color in the sky, it's ineffective and gives the impression of having been a color image post processed into an evening image."

  "The impression given by the title does not equal the impression given by the image. The image itself is well lighted, there is a massive amount of detail available to look at in the marina and the sky is on the edge of night which is in direct contradiction to the concept of \"dark\". It's still a competant image, but not terrible effective given the title and the challenge subject."

  "Dropping out of third person mode for a single image, I'm always fascinated by the compare/contrast of title and image. In this case, the immediate impression was it's a good title, but a better one would have been \"Isn't it Romantic\". :>) Ahem - anyway, this image is very artistically impressive for several reasons. The partially lit faces, vague details, soaring staircase leading up, the foot against the wall - it's a perfect set piece that has all the appearance and feel of a candid portrait. The use of light and dark in addition to subtle color is sound, although the deep background could use a little more saturation. It's only natural to offer a suggestion and if the author has the chance to revisit this scene, a little (very little) foreground light would enhance the romantic effect. Originally an 8, it has been rerated to a 9."

  "At first glance, the impression was of catacombs and given the title, it still could apply. A very nice conversion and there is nothing wrong with it from a technical standpoint. From an artistic standpoint, it lacks in impact even though there is plenty to look at, it just seems like it's all the same. A suggestion might be to have taken this from a different angle and using bokeh to create a sense of depth and dimension which is lacking."

A nice fade to dark on the model, but the ear on the left is immediately noticable and prominent - a little more angle on the lighting would have avoided this distraction. The smoke curls is a little over done - a simpler plume that was more figured would have been a better choice. Given that the initial reaction was humorous, it doens't quite have the drama and impact in an artistic sense that it should have. Still, a competant image."

The shadow figure is much more dramatic than the subject and conveys the intent of the title in a much more efficient way than the subject itself. On the other hand, if the shadow figure is removed from the image and the subject is used, there is much the same effect, but the less than complimentary lighting is a negative. They just don't seem to work well together. Given the lighting, it might have been a better choice to work with the shadow figure. Technically competant capture in difficult lighting conditions."
 ],
 "788222.jpg": [
  "Elegant in it's simplicity, the image, while good, just doesn't quite work as well as it could have. There is a vague sense of this image being unfinished in some way that is unsettling. After a good long look, that unease comes from the very vague detail on the spire - left side which is the back of the spire - just barely discernable against the black background. The eye wants to track that detail and that is not quite possible. A different angle or shooting the subject head on might have been a better choice."

  "Excellant black and white conversion that wasn't fully appreciated on first ratings speed review. On comment review, there is one issue that immediately makes an impression and that is the very slightly overdone white spotlight. That being said, the rest of the image is technically excellant and a good example of the zone system at it's best. Given that the spot light is actually the reason this image has it's own wow/pop factor, the image is rerated from a 6 to an 8. Well done."

While not a major issue, the nit pick in this case is the little white spots on the shoulders of the subject - they are out of place and distracting to the eye. Effectively lighted, the impression is positive and while the little highlights akin to hot pixels are annoying, it is still an effective presentation. More attention to the little highlights would have made this a better image. The original rating of 7 was a little harsh given the other positive aspects, so it has been rerated to an 8."

  "While the author's intent is clear, a little closer look at the computer screen and subject would have improved this image significantly - there is a little too much light on the screen and not enough on the subject in addition to the rather vague focus on the monitor. In images like this, it's always a plus to give the viewer something detailed to look at to compare to the blank space. From an artistic standpoint, there is too much blank space and it would have been better to use a little closer look at the subject."

The author's intent here is clear and with a more effective crop at the top of the image, the artistic impact would have been significant. An experiment the author may wish to attempt would be to layer a more dramatic sky into this image and lighten some of the darker areas using the histogram as the guide and the curves control to lighten some of the darker areas."

  "Someone once told me to try and shoot so that your photo is not title dependent.  When I vote, I usually do not see the title so I kind of depend on the image to tell me a story.  When I voted on your photo, I gave it a 5.  I saw several different elements all competing for my attention so I did not know what your main subject was in the shot.  You don't need so much of the counter in the foreground because it does not enhance the image.  Personally, what I think would have been cool would be to remove everything but the coffee maker.  Pull it away from the wall a bit and have the photo be that and the tile.  The black against the beautiful colors in that tile would have made for a great contrast."

 "787821.jpg": [
  "Moonlight images are always difficult to capture and this is a very good example of why. Using grayscale, the image appears to be washed out. While very good from an artistic impression standpoint, the shadows aren't deep (black) enough to really create a significant pop to invite the viewer to stay longer and look at the details. After viewing this for a third time, there is a lot to look at, but the image needs much more contrast to be truly effective. Use of the zone system when composing this image and a deft touch in post processing using curves to bring out it's best features would have been a better choice."

  "The immediate impression is not a positive one. The highlights, while right on the edge of being edge of being over done, are very distracting and immediately draw the eye to them. This is very unfortunate technical issue because from an artistic sense, this would have been a very good minimalist image with some very interesting artistic aspects - notably, the interesting optical effect at the bottom of the glass and the pickles in the cup of the glass. A little more thought and lighting control would have given this image a high place in the challenge."

  "The last image viewed and one that required three different views, the decision is to offer a well done for a competantly exposed and captured image from a technical standpoint. Nothing seems out place and there are no technical issues that can be readily discerned. From an artistic sense, it fails to really provide an interesting subject to view and relate to. In cases like this, it's usually the fault of the reviewer to properly place the image into context - the result of being underwhelmed by it's artistic properties which is a highly personal opinion which might not be shared by others. Given that it's technically competant and that it matches the challenge criteria exactly, it's more than worthy of a high rating."

  "Great idea and really good composition.  However, i feel the subject is overexposed.  Always hard to expose correctly with all this black areas, but I think the square is too light, and could easily have been darker and still given the overall effect you were after, and presented better colours and scene"

 "787707.jpg": [
  "The initial impression is - very clever, a child's hands and a dolls head - then on another look, there is a different opinon - and a third and so on. A terrific composition which makes one wonder how it was done. The linear background shading is so subtle that one doesn't notice it on first viewing, or the second for that matter - it only appears on a third view, but that being said, it affects the image in a positive way - gives a sense of depth and dimension not often seen in grayscale images of this type - a deft touch with brightness and contrast is being demonstrated here. Very well done. Probably not to everyone's taste, it's still worthy of consideration for a high finish."

 "787690.jpg": [
  "Sometimes an idea that seems like a good one, just fails to impress on execution. A uncommon fault in food images, the highlights negatively affect the overall impression of this image. Lighting in these situations is important and in this case, the blooms don't enhance, but detract. A suggestion for the future would be to avoid direct overhead lighting and/or fill the area with a fill flash technique or even indirect incandescent - the later of which would bring out more color and give a better focus point."

  "When first viewed, the immediate reaction was \"how was this done\" as it appeared to be floating in space. A terrific impression was immediately made even with the technical issues such as being overly dark with some vague details at the top and bottom. None the less, it came across as very inventive and clever imagery - the author obviously had a good eye for the unusual. The overall effect is positive even with the less than perfect technical issues - artistically, it's a great capture. Well done."
 ],
 "787663.jpg": [
  "The immediate impact of this image is not technical but artistic - it's a stellar capture in which the details compliment the title and the subjects exactly match the impression the author tried to convey. From a technical standpoint, it is exceptional and above average for the general challenge - the exacting tones of black, gray and white demonstrate an indepth knowledge of the zone system and it's use - a perfect conversion and well worth the time to examine closely in addition to the vague, yet detailed background which again, demonstrates mastery of bokeh both as a concept and a photographic tool. A complete technical and artistic success that by rights should place well into the challenge if not a ribbon winner. Well done."
 ],
 "787642.jpg": [
  "Little issues like the spoon fading into the plate and the rather drastic white to red comparison effect this image in a negative way. While technically sufficient, it's artistic impression is less than perfect. A suggestion would have been to take a longer look at this image, less light to enhance the silver settings which would have brought the complimentary details of the plate edge into the image - the fade isn't as effective in this image as it is in others. A little higher angle would have helped as well. A good effort with some minor issues that effect the image as a whole."

A little less dark highlighting the profile would have improved this image significantly creating a mood piece that would have scored well.

  "There are two ways to look at this image - one, it has a lot of blank space which could be viewed as a negative. Or one could view the rather large space as a positive controlling the core subject by bringing the eye to the object instead of away from it. In either case, this works fine as it is, although the offset to the left could be a little less strong to eliminate the sense of space while keeping the same image size. The image is technically successful without any significant issues - properly focused showing rich detail complimented by the reflection on the surface. As a stand alone art print, it also works as the soft reflected light addresses the need for depth and dimension. Well done - this would work very well as a photo-on-canvass print."

  "This is a great concept that falls just shy of having major impact on the viewer. For future reference, this could be made much better by using a layer approach exposing the sky more to gain an impression of depth and dimension in addition to increasing the drama of a night beach conversation. Still a very good impression is given even with the slightly over done lanterns. Another approach might have been to concentrate on the subject with a closer in look at a reduced exposure time or aperature. Very nice concept."

 "787384.jpg": [
  "While a technical success, from an artistic standpoint, this image fails to impress. It is properly framed and composed, there just isn't anything to really impress the viewer on first review and this carried over to rating and comment review. A good concept which might have been improved by being a little smaller with a closer look at the subject rather than the landscape. Too much space would be another way to put it."

  "Very pretty subject for this flower side challenge.  One of the flowers is a little blown out in the highlights.  That is hard to avoid when you have such a wide range of lighting as you had in front of you here.  Not much could be done once the shot had been taken, but maybe you could recognize this situation in the future and either shade the flower or move it a little so that either all or none of it is in direct sunlight.  I very often use my tripod to move water lilies that are just beyond my reach while I take the shot using one hand to hold the camera."
 ],
 "787239.jpg": [
  "A moment frozen in time. Technically competant, the lack of motion leaves a static impression that, while not negative, isn't positive either - it would help to have some movement to express the idea - this image gives an impression of being a \"trick\" image rather than a natural physical action/reaction. A good solid entry into the challenge."
 ],
 "787223.jpg": [
  "There is an interesting effect here that can be viewed two ways. One, that it's a flaw and two, it's a direct reflection of the title vs the image. Given that the image is effective, if not overly powerful from an emotional or artistic standpoint, the second impression is more likely the right one. There is also a rather intriguing anomaly in this image - the right side forhead is squared off which is in direct contradiction to the rather nicely formed and exposed curve on the left. In one way, the rather squared forehead is very Frankenstein's monster in effect. Given that there are several ways to view this image, the fair thing is to rerate it from a 7 to an 8."

  "I really like the combination of the flower and the aged box. NICE!! And I love the bit of blur too! But I have to admit I'm with   and would like to see more contrast; more specifically, more dark tones. In general the effect of the gradient filter is really nice, but if this were my image I would continue to process it with a levels layer to darken those dark tones. If you don't want more contrast, then either think of using this as a texture layer or cool background as   suggested, or even add a layer on top of it to grunge it up a bit and add more interest as we do in this . Bottom line is I see a lot of good to work with here!"

  "One of the few table top reflection images that is properly composed and captured - every geometrical feature is exactly where it should be and demonstrates the effectiveness of precision and a complete thought process in staging and capture. Where it falls just a little short is that the artistic impression does not match the technical excellance. The flat tonal quality of the image, while not a huge negative, is a little deficient in creating a matching wow or pop factor to the technical expertise. Still, an exceallant image matching the challenge criteria perfectly. If a little more color could have been added, it would have placed extremely high if not a ribbon winner. As it is, it should place well within the top twenty. Well done."

In this image, the grain is obviously present for effect, but the vague subject matter decreases it's impact.

In this case, the immediate reaction was not completely positive, but after sitting back and taking in the whole gestalt of this particular image the idea came into context. Very scifi, the clever combination of Enter and Backspace in addition to the blue sine wave ties the whole title/image combination together although it isn't immediately apparent.

  "This is the fourth time this image has been viewed and it still offers a rather vague and ambigous impression. After thinking about it for a few minutes and closely examining the features and technique used, the answer appeared. The problem lies with the sugar in the clear jar. Ball jars have been considered as objects 'd art for many, many years and this image does not do them justice. While technicaly acceptable, the artistic impression is flat and totally uninteresting. One suggestion might have been to do a color image and use lighting gels (actually any clear colored plastic with a portable light source) to enhance and create some reflection and inject some color into the jar to make it stand out against the white of the sugar. This would also have helped the adjacent jar stand out beause it has the same problem only different because it's empty. The composition and positioning of the jars is fine and effective - it just needs some help to increase interest and artistic impact."

This image would have presented a much more positive impression if it had been shorter concentrating the viewer on the bird and not the background.

THe horizon is cutting right through the puppy's head, creating an unbalancing impression.

Additionally, the author might have done better to get a closer capture of the subject's face which is the image's most interesting feature. The use of bokeh could have been better and with a closer look at the subject from a different angle to provide a contrasting background would have improved this image tremendously. The author might want to use some post processing magic with the sky and see if the image can be enhanced with a substitution or better treatment. A good worthy entry into the challenge."

In this instance a technical success isn't quite the artistic success it should be.

While this is a unqualified technical success, from an artistic standpoint, the color detracts from the subject's emotional impact and it might have been more effective as a black and white or grayscale - the color just seems too bright and positive by comparision to the title. Having said that, it is effective and should rate high in the competition. Well done."

  "Sometimes images fail to impress on first view for any number of reasons - maybe it's the color, the subject or that the reviewer needs more caffines to stay awake. The simple elegance of this subject, rich in detail and properly framed is an excellant example of a candid moment. From a technical standpoint, it's nearly perfect with a vaguely detailed background complimenting the rich detail of the subject. From an artistic standpoint, the facial expession is directly opposed to the overall joyfull feel of the scene which is somewhat off putting but an honest view. Originally rated an 8, this is rerated to a 9. It should place well in the challenge and possibly a top ten."

  "The grizzled veteran cop is always a suitable subject for candid photography and this borders on being the perfect piece of photo journalism. The sense of concentration and \"seen it all\" visage is a homage to police officers who toil every day to protect and serve from the mundane traffic duty to preventing serious crime, this is an outstanding effort on the part of the author to portray an uncommon sympathetic view of law enforcement officers. One minor issue might be a little better crop on the left, but it certainly is very effective as it is. An excellant conversion only compliments the overall capture. Well done."

This only increases the rather flat colors of the subject. A little more time taken while composing would have only benefitted this image positively. While there are some very noticable technical flaws, the artistic impression over comes these flaws in a very effective presentation. Well done."

  "Real beautiful picture but the overall impression is that it is posed. It might not be but it certainly gives that impression.",
  "Dramatic and impressive in an artistic sense if only because of the nature of the subject. The image needs to be viewed more than once to properly evaluate the dark and the details that lurk within - not an image that takes kindly to casual viewing. While not to the general taste, this is an amazing image in several respects. The dark photographer appears to be over sharpened but that may be artifact from the back lighting. A very impressive conversion, this was orignally rated an 8, but on review, has been rerated a 10 for it's innovative approach to the subject challenge in addition to it's technical and artistic success.  While it might not place high, any reviewer who has been involved in photography more than a few years will recognise the technique used here to express an idea which was more than expertly executed. Well done."

From a technical standpoint, it's perfect - everything from the saturation just approaching being over the edge, to the excellant complexion of the subject and the little details of character, it's exceptional. From an artistic standpoint, it lacks any context or frame of reference to make this a truly \"candid\" image. In any other challenge where portrature is a component, this might have worked, but it falls just short of being truly candid."

 "784235.jpg": [
  "Truly good conversions to black and white are difficult and this is a good exmaple of the zone system and how it impacts an image. In this instance a technical success isn't quite the artistic success it should be. While a good candid look at an introspective moment, the subject is short of having some sort of pop or wow factor that provides the image with some impact - it's just a candid moment. While photographers can't always be in the right place at the right time with the right camera and the right lens, this might have been improved by a crop of the top to make the image longer and giving the image a sense of dimension - while detailed the background is overly detailed and detracts from the image's impact. The author should experiment wtih varying top crops to get the best effect. A good solid entry into the challenge."

The sense of \"moment\" is present in this image and the obvious character being captured carries some visual impact. Technically, it's a very well composed image which is a plus.  From an artistic standpoint, it lacks impact. A worthy entry into the challenge just lacking that something special to make it stand out."

 "784156.jpg": [
  "A solid image that is crisp, sharp and properly framed and composed, it fails a little from being slightly out of context - it takes a long time to find the subject matter. From an artistic standpoint, it is an interesting image but of less than universal appeal because of it's large expanse and the small subjects. A good entry into the challenge that could have used a little more thought."

 "784086.jpg": [
  "Sometimes the little things are overlooked that make a major impact on an image that should be a winner. While the darks are highly detailed and well controlled, the whites are just slightly out of control on the left which is distracting when the image is viewed as a whole. When the individual pieces of the image are taken into account, the subject is extremely well lit and captured rich in detail and properly presented. The background, while properly vague, is too vague and could use some more definition to give the impression of depth and dimension as it appears to be flat which detracts from the foreground detail. There are quite a few technical issues with this image (like the washed out chess pieces) in the reviewers opinon. However, once again, the incredible subject with the rich detail and sense of purpose overcome the technical problems and make this a worthy entry into the challenge - perhaps even a top fifteen entry."

 "784100.jpg": [
  "A solid image that is properly framed and composed with appropriately detailed subject matter - a couple of minor technical issues like the reflections in the eyes and the soft fade on the right do not impact the image in a major way - a technical success with minor flaws.

Originally rated a 9, the image has been bumped to a 10 as this viewer feels this should properly be a top ten image if not a ribbon contender. Well done."

Black & White was a good choice for this pic. Nice. Interesting how the area of focus is the foot; while everything else managed to just make it....interesting."

The subject intrigues me - smartly dressed, with his kindly looking face, apparently completing a newspaper crossword, and somewhat strangely, with a tape measure hanging down inside his jacket.

  "Unforced imagery is always a plus and this appears to be very natural and unforced. It might have been better to get a little tighter in on the subject and eliminate a large portion of the wall, but it works as is. The focus seems a little softer than it should be which may be a by-product of the black and white conversion or maybe decompression from RAW. It's not immediately noticable though so that's a plus. A very good candid portrait and certainly a top twenty image if not a top ten. Well done."

Are you serious ?

  "Peter~ your picture has a nice polished feel to it(processing, etc.). The textures of the various elements are really nice. What bothers me most is the actual subject matter-- The fence creates a barrier to exploration, to wandering through the landscape(figuratively and literally). To me, a well done landscape invites exploration. Not that a person couldn't just hop over the fence, haha, but I'm kind of a by-the-rules sort. Not sure if this makes sense to you, it's just my reaction to your image(and yours may be entirely different)."

There are times when the simple things fascinate our little ones and they become more than casual observers of their world - this image captures that interest perfectly with an excellant composition. Originally, this reviewer voted this an eight because of a perceived technical issue, but on review, this viewer was clearly mistaken and will rerate it a 10. It is near perfect technically with vaguely detailed background and crisp sharp focus - the color combinations are excellant and effective. From an artistic stanpoint, it is a cut above the average submission in this challenge with top ten potential. Well done."

At first, the impression was that the image was a true DNMC, but on comment review, the subject was finally found. From a technical standpoint, this is a purely technical success and in another setting would be a terrific image, but to meet this challenge, this reviewer feels that hunting for the title subject is a major flaw. Perhaps a more central focus on the subject matter (meaning that it would be less offset) would have been a much better approach."

 "782391.jpg": [
  "The drama inherent in how the subject was revealed is good, but it's a rather stock piece seen in other images and not particularly \"creative\". Having said that, it's still a great image - strong and purposeful mood piece that would work well in any other venue or challenge and place well."

 "782365.jpg": [
  "Sometimes a theme invokes a different idea or concept and this is clearly one of those images which meet the challenge subject in completely different fashion than one might normally expect. A great idea which falls short of perfection. The overally flat tones and color detracts from the subject's impact. The DOF control is sound and effective. If this image could have been tone mapped, it would have helped tremendously and probably would have been a ribbon contender. A good solid entry into the challenge.",
  "I'm not sure what this is, but it got owned by a train I think :) Wait - is that a bicycle wheel and gear?! Ouch. The subject is cool and I had fun trying to figure out what it is, but the tracks being so much brighter than the subject is a bit distracting."

 "782351.jpg": [
  "My first impression of the image is that it has immediate impact - the zoom burst actively sucks the viewer into the picture, into the front of the oncoming train. The processing is extreme, but actually really quite appeals to me - I think it adds to the in your face impact of the shot (it somehow seems appropriate that the viewer is forced to fight the onslaught of the incoming train, I think it creates an interesting kind of emotional engagement with the shot). The nightmarish quality is rather appropriate given the perspective in this case."

Well done and a solid entry into the challenge because of it's technical and artistsic success."
 ],
 "782232.jpg": [
  "From a technical standpoint this is good, but flawed. The over dark subject matter as compared to the title doesn't quite work. This flaw affects the image from an artistic standpoint, it's rather bland and uninviting to the viewer. Sometimes an image is just an image and author's need to recognise that. Having said that a worthy entry into the challenge and directly related to the challenge subject. A good effort falling short in being a success in the technical and artistic sense."

A very unique look at the subject matter, this will surely be a ribbon contender if only for it's perfectly executed concept. An artistic and technical success in every sense. Well done."

 "782202.jpg": [
  "The angle you have taken the photo at suits the subject well, but the photo doesn't really work for me.  The shadows on the walls are a little distracting, and the processing has resulted in some obvious haloing. Given the museum exhibit type setting, I wonder if a better choice might have been to go in much closer and pick out some interesting detail in the wheels or funnel?"

  "A combination of pastoral scene and challenge subject this is beautiful and artistic perfection. Green is the most difficult color to properly control digitally and the author has not only accomplished that in spectacular fashion, but used it to properly balance the tones of the rail car. Not a single issue to nit pick - even the reflection in the car's windows is perfectly focused and presented. A perfect example of a well though out image congnizant of the challenge subject and artistic impression. A ribbon winner for sure. Well done."

What is SETI thinking!! lol...ehh, anyways, the image...very nice color, love the rich yellow matched with the auburn, perhaps one satellite like the one of the right would be enough for this.

The minor over done light on the chest of the subject is a distraction, but given the general atmosphere projected by this image, it more than meets the criteria of effective lighting demonstration. Well done - a ribbon contender."

  "From a technical standpoint, this is a terrific effort - crisp, sharp with everything detail well controlled and captured. From an artistic standpoint, it's rather bland and uninviting to the viewer because it's overly busy affecting and detracting from the subject matter. Sometimes an image, even one as technically competant as this one is, is just an image. A worthy entry into the challenge and directly related to the challenge subject. A good effort falling short in the artistic sense."
 ],
 "781941.jpg": [
  "A terrific look at the mechanicals of an old steam engine with a few minor flaws. The white highlights could have been better controlled - a little different angle away from the subject would possibly have helped with that. A very interesting change from light to dark and full of rich detail. The image appears to be a little less sharp that it could be. A good, sound effort both technically and artistically. A worthy entry into the challenge."

 "781907.jpg": [
  "It's a hard subject challenge and this reviewer is having just as hard of a time properly rating images in the challenge.  Having said all that however, this is a spectacular image and in any other setting and/or challenge would be a sure top ten image - it's spectacular, well controlled and very dramatic."
 ],
 "781851.jpg": [
  "Several views of this image did not affect the initial impression of the author being not only creative with lighting, but using light to great effect with the extremely clever inclusing of all three colors into the stem of the center glass. Perfect DOF control. An example of how creative use of lighting and lighting systems can create a stunning image. A ribbon contender if not an outright winner."
 ],
 "781855.jpg": [
  "Sometimes the image so matches the challenge subject that speechless is the only comment one can make if one uses a loose definition of \"creative\" which would be inspired - this is certainly in the inspired category. The rich color and detail is remarkable and highlighted perfectly. This reviewer can find enough superlatives to describe the pure raw emotion and impact of this image. Wonderful is inadequate, brilliant portraiture come close. A favorite to win a ribbon.",
  "Excellent subject and content.  The side lighting suits perfectly, and meets the challenge.  But the image seems to lack depth for some reason."
 ],
 "781828.jpg": [
  "A good effort not properly thought through - the white space is over done and does not compliment the subject or the transition to darker shades. The stark contrast between the background the foreground is also a negative.",

  "This is one of those on the margin images that with a little more thought, could have been an outstanding entry into the challenge. The subject matter is being demonstrated, but the subject is distorted by the image's insistance on looking at the model and not the model drawing the tattoo with crayons. It might have helped to change the focus to the tattoo and the hand holding the crayon and have kept the artist less in focus to create a much more effective image with a lot of visual impact. A good idea just a little short on execution."

  "This reviewer's initial impression was extremely negative, but after returning to the image and figuring out exactly what the image contained, this is a high score. A little too subtle in the abstract sense, this could have been mistaken for a different object in particular with the smoke. On further review though, the image matches the title and is very clever - something to consider when reviewing is not to jump to comclusions as this reviwer did. That may be a problem for this image from a general appeal standpoint, but technically and artistically, this is an outstanding effort on the part of the author and should be viewed as a clever, creative, properly lighted and focused with amazing impact. If there were justice in the one to ten voting system, this would be a perfect ten and if a Hall of Fame existed on DPC, a sure entry into the pantheon of imaginative and illusionary photography. A 10++ from this reviewer - well done."

Second, I think if you had something (a tree, a flower, a leaf of grass, etc.) as a subject and then had all the rest of this flora as a background it would have more focus to it. Right now it almost feels like an accidental shot because there's no specific subject and it doesn't really offer anything impressive as far as a landscape goes."

The red flowers on the tree dominate.  The center of the image makes you focus on the radio tower.  I think the sign needs to dominate, probably look for a different angle where you can compose the Hollywood sign with the hill and be able cut out the radio tower for sure.  Maybe try a vertical shot with the sign toward the upper third and lower third with the homes/studios below to convey that ordinary folks are looking up and \"dreaming\" of being Hollywood stars....  Maybe look for an angle maybe miles toward your left.  Its looks like from the overlap of the letters that you are way to the right of center of the sign.  So my critique would be try a different angle and try a vertical shot."

First I thought it was a photo of a collection of nostalgic items, then I saw the girl(?) in thought or talking to someone across from her or perhaps on a cell phone.

Love the clouds and the gleam on the water's surface that looks like a pathway. Speaking of the pathway it leads our eye to the main subject of the composition. We see the outpost first but then our eye spots the human element. The man that is sitting there watching...but watching what we ask? Perhaps he is a lookout or perhaps he is like us, just watching the fantastic display on storm clouds. A storm seems to be brewing and there might be a spectacular light show off in the distance of cloud to cloud lightning or lightning strikes upon the water. The composition's mood and feel really draws us in. This holds many story elements. Well done!"

Because they are all moving, they make up a single entity in the pic. They provide the contrast to the second group of pigeons which are in flight.",

The only thing I find lacking in this photo is the fact that the subject is stopped and looking at the camera, as opposed to 'trekking' through the dunes.

  "Voted earlier coming back to leave comments now. This is a great portrait of this man...from the side profile you present to us he has a little of the James Dean look going. The portrait captures a casual relaxed look such that it does not appear posed at all and it might not be. Either way posed or casual capture the main subject is easy and relaxed in front the the camera and his pose appears completely natural. He is relaxed with his hand casually holding on the cig he has take puffs from. He looks over to study something that the viewer just can't see. It seems to hold his attention as he studies it and it leaves us, the viewers, to wonder just what it is that has captured his attention. Lighting and focus are excellent. I like the B&W but I think the tonal range could use a boost so the differences between the light and dark areas are more dynamic and visually pop more. Other than that this is a great portrait."

Backlighting is nice, DOF is appropriate, composition is good, looking off-frame creates interest.  Still, the facial expression leads me to believe she's either watching a wedding she doesn't approve of or has seen someone she once was very close to while at a funeral."

They are absolutely freezing in that cold chilly wintery wind! I can feel the cold just by looking at these three. The 'nun' on the far right is none too happy and actually looks as if her teeth are going to chatter in the next second. I can't decide between two different interpretations of what her expression says. The first impression is that she is freezing and her teeth ARE chattering. The other expression is of impatience...'hurry up and take the bleeding shot!' perhaps?:-) The possible story of why these three nuns are out in the cold has me wondering why ARE they there. Perhaps they are doing penance....Perhaps the cold is symbolic of the fact that they are doubting their religion and have been left 'cold' with no answers but only more questions...the story possibilities are endless."

  "A lovely simple-complex photograph.  I imagine this to inhabit that sacred ground between a candid and a posed portrait ... I'm sure the photographer does not know the man, and yet it's not a stolen moment like most 'street' photographs.  Instead it's a moment; the man sees the photographer, there is an instant of unspoken communication, and then an instant of shared salute, each to the other.  Exactly the thing that makes photography a matter of connection ... between photographer and subject, between photographer and viewer, and (most magically of all) between subject and viewer.  The man knows he's going to be looked at by people he will never know, and he salutes them, even more than he salutes the person with the camera.  So it's a one-of-a-kind moment, never to be repeated.  9."

We see babies, and the brain automatically wants to think awwww and cuteness...but this isn't. The wee one is being held with but one hand, almost like one holds a melon. And whom I assume is the father seems bored, if he can be read at all. There is an absence of tenderness, at least the sort of the tenderness that the general audience comes to expect in a parent/child image. Very intriguing photograph.",

The position suggests that the subject is contemplating about something not so good, and that's verified by lack of a real face.  The background you've chosen suggests movement and energy to me, especially the \"waves\" coming off the area near hands.  Low key works perfectly here.",

The closest headstone, which I'm thinking is the main subject here, is too centred, which has left the ones running out of the right side pretty much drawing a line across the middle of the frame. This in turn has left quite a bit of background on the left side with the headstones there again running out of the middle of the frame, almost giving you a sort of centred horizon.",

  "Hmm...  Is the subject supposed to be asking this question?  Because by the silhouette, this certainly doesn't strike me as a homeless or poor person.  The backlighting of the sun is nice, but it looks as though post processing has caused the light around the subject to look fake.",
  "Voted earlier coming back now to leave comments. For me I see the story unfolding here as \"The Golden Hour\". The main subject is mainly cast in silhouette so there are really no identifying features other than the handbag that is being held. The story I get from looking upon this image is a day of shopping at the markets or browsing the stores along the street - window shopping and getting a bite to eat at a local bistro. What really draws me is the warm golden tones of this capture and the feel that this is a quick glance imagery in that we are actually there observing the scene in real time (something the Lomo photography really does a good job in capturing - the feel of everyday life). Those warm hues make me think of a warm summer day or even autumn (those golden hues - leaves starting to turn gold and orange). You even have some rays and the person is wrapped in a warm glow of gold/orange hues. I feel that it adds to a sense of season and adds to the feel of the piece. The biggest critique I have for this (yeah, I know did you have to get picky)is that there are some odd blotches or spots on the top half of the pants of the main subject. I don't know if that it was from the processing or if they were actually there on the pants and the processing may have emphasized them. If it is due to processing then that can be easily remedied. It also might help to improve the visual impact of the photo by deepening the tones on the silhouette of the person to true black - something one can achieve by patiently selecting the person, feathering the selection to avoid hard edges, and either lowering the gamma all the way or brightness all the way. Of course, it could be that you see the silhouette as true black on your monitor and are wondering what the heck is she talking about. I, myself, have run into that situation where I see the silhouette as nice, deep dark shades but not everyone's monitor is calibrated the same plus the newer flat screen monitors seem to be much brighter than the older bulkier models."

  "Let's start around a 5.5 image.  That's a good place because it is an image with promise that let us down.  I see you were hoping for more on this one too.  The choice of subject is good.  A very interesting building.  Your composition is at least not straight on, but it is a bit static in that there is little or no context for us (sometimes that can't be helped and I don't know what's there that I can't see).  The HDR is a good choice because it allowed you to keep detail in the sky, BUT I see two problems.  One, and I'm pretty sure you know this now, your colors are crazy.  I'm all about saturated colors, but not when they look unnatural.  We've hit that point here.  Two, the clouds in the sky are too lopsided.  You have half a blue sky and half with clouds.  I think that generally degrades the image and sometimes you just have to sit and wait until you get a better balance."

  "Voted earlier coming back to leave comments. \"Ani Lidodi Vidodi Lee\" (I am to my beloved and my beloved is mine\" When I first heard that and it's translation I loved the saying for it is very much akin to a romantic poem in of itself. From the subject of the photo I believe a congrats (or belated one) in in order:-) Now, onto the photo. Simple, clean and minimalistic in presentation and the conveying of feeling with the title. The golden hues and light that dominate the photo impart a warm feeling. Now the critique, (gak, I know, I know...picky picky right:-) ). I think the composition could be even better if you brought us closer to your main subject - the ring. That would eliminate the harsh shadow that we see to the right. Also, I think that the message be all the  on the emotion of everlasting love if you had two rings resting together touching each other in the composition rather than the lone one."

This is the impression I get as I watch the forces of nature at work in your shot. Very beautiful and scenic shot of this beach - while beautiful I feel the calm before a storm for I see rain bands far off in the distance to the left of the composition. There is one other human element that chooses to brave Mother Nature's display (aside from us the viewer) and that is the lone oil tanker that I see far off into the distance. Of course that could be an island in which case I am very wrong:-) Love the capture of a moment in time as the water crashes upon the rocks and we see the explosive spray in fine detail. Colors and detail are wonderful. Great job on this seascape capture.",

  "First, I love your subject and the look on her face.  This is a wonderful capture.  However, your image does have a red tint to it that is easily fixed using post processing.  Since I don't know which software you are using, it is very difficult to suggest the easiest way to correct this but it can be done with Hue/Saturation or with Curves.  The soft touch filter you applied to this image probably hurt your score more than the white issue.  The DPC crowd really likes the eyes to be sharp especially with an image like yours where the eyes really engage the viewer.  Third, almost every image looses sharpness when it is downsized to 640 pixels.  This made your Soft Filter even softer."

 ],
 "769328.jpg": [
  "From a compositional point, this is OK, but could have been improved a bit by a step to the left. Meaning that the main subject would have been at a slightly different angle, rather than straight on.  The focus is not particularly sharp, which will hurt.  I see that a function of using a slowish shutter speed (1/20) rather than a use of selective focus from Depth of Field.  It is almost impossible to handhold and shoot below 1/60 and the longer the focal length of the lens the faster the shutter speed needs to be to avoid camera shake.  With your lens, focal lengths between 18 & 60 you can get away with 1/60, but at 135, you would need a shutter speed more like 1/160 to keep the subject sharp.  Of course, if your lens has VR (vibration reduction), then you may be able to use slighly lower shutter speeds when handholding."

I THINK, that a tighter crop to the upper right, so the sun is in the lower and left 1/3, would be better. Why? Because while the softer water at the bottom is cool, what Really Draws me into the photo is the sun, and the clouds and by making them more of a subject in the photo (via crop) I think it would be 'right'"

Like some of the others, I would have cropped this more panoramic (I am a fan of Panoramic crops anyway), removing a little of the foreground and the sky, as I feel there is a little too much 'Dead Space' at teh moment.  I would have also liked the reds to be a little more vibrant, as I feel that would have added further to the end result.  Having said all of that, its a great capture."

You've got a couple of elements I really like in the shot - the curved upper branch, the sun peeking through, the curve of the wall/bushes.

Maybe it will score better had the model not wear the mask.  Just my opinion, but I like it nonetheless.",

You can't see any natural beauty in the girl, as its all masked behind your softening. It is also done very blotchy on her skin, which isn't very appealing. compositionaly I think you could have pulled in one of the top corners to take the subject off center. I think it may have helped a lot if you shot down onto the model, which would give more definition to the subjects jaw and face. the sharpness is nice on the eye though. It would be nice to let the picture stand on its own instead of editing it so much. Personally I'm not a huge fan of the pose, the knee is distracting, and in the way, I find myself mentally trying to look around it. My advice is try and take full advantage of the incredible gear you have and the sharpness it can give."

  "I'm not caring for this I'm afraid. I think the biggest problem, for me, is in the composition. The main subject seems to be intended to be the waterfall, which is a thin strip, centered in the frame, partially hidden by the field in the foreground. That field is the brightest and largest thing in the frame and it is what attracts the eye instead of the waterfall. A closer view of this waterfall, perhaps at an angle of from river level, might have been quite nice."

I didn't vote on this but would probably have given it a 5 or 4.  FYI, I don't give much weight to captions (titles), but I \"got\" the puzzling idea without it."

The composition is intriguing, I feel drawn in and fascinated the longer I look at it. There is some visible noise that could have been minimized by using a lower ISO and longer shutter speed (tripod), but apart from minor technical shortcomings, this is a great piece of fine art.

Sails lowered and moored in the bay, the yachts certainly add to this effect, as do the relatively calm waters of the bay. Overall, the scene is exposed properly, though I would say there is a small sliver of the cloud that seems to be a bit overexposed. I might suggest bringing out a bit more detail in the hulls of the yachts, since they are focal points. Currently, they are a bit in the middle, being dark but not quite a silhouette."

A couple things; the seagull appears to be on a dock, but the plane of the dock doesn't match the sea, I'm assuming because they are the two different pictures.  Also, it looks like only the small birds in the middle are in focus, probably an effect of the Lensbaby.  Apparently it's important to have the subject centered when using Lensbaby if you want the subject in focus.  The bright gull really stands out against the rest of a very dark picture."

  "Suggestions for Improvements: Either pan out or zoom in. Try not to crop at the joint of the arm and torso, it makes your subject look like an amputee. When using a flash, dial it down as far as it will go and then step it up as needed to brighten the photograph. Flat lighting is lighting that is even and has no shadows. We need shadows as photographers to help the viewer see depth in our portraits. To let them know that this person is not a drawing, but are 3D. Turning of the face away from the camera a bit helps with shadow and depth as well. Tilting the head puts the eyes on different lines and gives us a bit of a pattern to follow around the face.  is a tutorial on posing. It's very very good. It also explains a lot about portrait lighting if you check out the earlier pages. :)"

  "Read through your comments, clearly the mood was well presented via the subject and your toning. I agree that the image is very interesting and intriguing, and I scored it a 7 because I love the mood, but the composition is potentially holding it back from a broader appeal. I agree that the horizon is splitting the photograph in half giving the image a slightly static feeling, and then it's tilted, which may be a function of the cloud layer. However, for me it works, and I love the feeling of the clouds creeping in over the horizon. The bright whites in the top right corner probably could be burned down, as it attracts the eye immediately dragging the viewer out of the frame. We may not think of this immediately, but I do believe that it limits the viewers enjoyment whether they no it or not. Finally the PP is a bit obvious in that I can see a trail from the layer mask over the lamppost. If I noticed trail over the lamp during voting I would have scored it lower, probably a 5. Obviously, we are nit picking, but also offering reasons why it may have score at 5.4. I will leave you this...I still like it despite \"seeing\" things I did not readily see during voting! The mood grabbed me and kept me.",

Just an idea, it would add a lot to your photo to include the subject of business or the environment into the background. A blurred cityscape with sky-screapers, or some computers as the product, anything. It would make your photo live! (3)"

I think titles are extremely important in setting the stage for the photo.  Some how the word itself matches the composition.  Something about the S and the curve of the branch.  Or maybe that ess sound reminds me of  gentle rustling of those branches in the wind.   Or maybe I've had 1 to many chocolate chip cookies before bed ;)   As far as subject matter, not exactly something I would have expected from the dpc underground, but you can't stay on the outside forever ;)"

I suspect a different pose from the subject would look more despairing to me; as it is he's pointed at a little rock and looks to be idly contemplating it.  From this distance body language needs to be extreme to convey an emotion, I think.  If I ignore the title the subject still looks kind of random and inconsequential.",

Somehow, conditions have just come together, broad light, frost and ice rounding the contours of things, the layers of ice, the smoothness and lack of micro detail, to craft a visual impression that this is actually a model, perhaps no taller than about 12 inches. However, the sea is made of tiny droplets, too small for a model, so that seeing this gives me a strange feeling of unreality - My mind finds it hard to accept that I am not looking at a model superimposed on a real seascape. As we can't see a very detailed full file image of the photo on this website, there is nothing I can do to lessen the strangeness of it.",

  "Love the expression, sharpness, and general composition, and agree with others that avoiding overprocessing is a big plus here. You have a lovely daughter and captured the moment well. I think the background does pull the eye away from the girl. Not the upper part of the wall, which is indistinct enough to add interest without being distracting (and the color tone there is a nice echo of her shirt). The booth seat has an interesting pattern that does not need to be blurred, but the yellow-green fights with the blue shirt and her eyes, and the magenta/orange elements are too similar to elements in her face. Please don't exaggerate these thoughts into negative comments, as the image is excellent."

In this shot, his posture alone isn't telling me that he's unlucky -- he could be asleep, relaxing his neck, any number of things (someone suggested looking at his watch). If you were there and  he was down on his luck, then you're already biased. The uninformed viewer doesn't have those additional contextual clues, so it's up to you to deliver them. My comment was suggesting that even a glimpse of his face could have driven the point home for the viewer. Then you wouldn't even need the title."

  "I saw your request for a comment on Art's 10,000th comment thread.  Here is my take.  First, the post processing on the cross (B&W conversion, contrast) is nicely done.  Two things hurt your score.  First was the subject itself.  The sand is not the main focus of the image no matter what your title implies.  Plus, fun cheerful images score better than this type of image.  Second, the background is extremely distracting.  If you cropped out the top 1/2 to 2/3 of the image (giving it a landscape orientation instead of portrait), the size and placement of the cross makes for a stronger composition."

  "Suggestions for Improvements: Composition: Perhaps a step to the right and a bit of a stoop would have helped this a bit. Rarely should you shoot straight on with no tilt or turn of the head or subject and stooping would have eliminated the wood in back running through the head and might have helped with the dog's feet as well. Lighting: Earlier in the morning or later in the evening make for the best lighting. Try to get outside earlier or later (depending on your sleeping habits). Exposure: Try for a higher f-stop or move the man's face further forward into the focal plane. That way the dog and the man can both be totally in focus. Pose: When taking a portrait, remember that you are in control of the shoot. Don't be afraid to guide your subjects. You know more than they do :)"

I would suggest playing with the crop, maybe a bit less negative space. I really enjoy the lighting that brings out the textures, nice work. Color and WB appear to be good, and it certainly meets the challenge."

A bit like a vignette, I suppose, but better (because it  and subtracts).  The interesting thing is that it's not just about the focus, is it?  There's a lot more to the LB than that, as these portraits show."

Also, your main subject (the ornament) gets a little bit lost in the background of black. Some soft light coming from the other side might have helped this (flashlight, perhaps?). The ribbon(?) that the ornament is hanging on is way too colourful for this shot. A pretty hook would have been a better choice. Remember to compliment your main subject, not take away the attention. Check out  and . The second has a lovely part about how to find out if you actually have sensor dust. I hope this helps :) Good luck!"

The overall image is very highly saturated (a bit too much for my taste) but the colour is nice and warm and gives a homey feeling to the tree and cross. Your placement of the cross is okay but the composition is a little loose... a move to the right slightly would have given more visual pleasure, IMO. Also, and this is just a little personal preference thing, I would like to have seen your cross with a bit more dramatic lighting... maybe with a black card behind it to only light it from the front... Crosses, by nature, create emotion. I think the emotion here would have been better played up by a little creative light :) Good luck!"

The worn border projects the sense of age which plays well with the main subject which is the dead flower."

Perhaps if they were smaller pieces such as rooks, they would not grab our attention so much. I think the angle of the board has room for improvement as well. Rotating the board even more might give this shot a little more drama. Overall it is an interesting shot, it just needs some more thought to take it to the next level."

I don't think it would have been nearly as good if it weren't for the light shinning underneath the door. There is no way of telling what room the tool is entering, but being in a house setting is related to where you would find this tool. This adds to the theme of personification. It's very difficult for me to find any flaws, which is reflected in the score you received. If I wanted to be really picky, I would say that I believe I can see the lamp on the other side of the door; the base and the head. All in all great photograph.

I like that is not looking into the largest negative space, which is the crop chosen most often. Yes the highlights are a tad overexposed.

So it doesn't make a good subject. Therefore, I turn to the person. Still, I am frustrated because I can't see that person and the silhouette isn't giving me any indication of what is going on here either. Perhaps if you would have included more of the person in the frame or blurred the bokeh just a tad less it would have worked beautifully. As it is, it doesn't catch and hold my attention.

The colours are great, and the relfections on the table are a nice added bonus. I am a little surprised that it did not score over 6. I do think that the ornament could use some improvement, so that is perhaps what held this photo back from being a top 20 shot. The ornament is a little dark overall. Having it lit a little brighter, or replacing it with a lighter coloured bulb would have made this a fantastic image. Keep up the good work."

There is obviously bokeh in this shot, and it helps the viewer stay focused on the insect, as nearly everything else is soft. I might be tempted to crop out some of the right hand side so that the shape of the image is more vertical. This would flow nicely with the long thing blade of grass. I think it is a nice shot, but it doesn't really speak to me. I am obviously one of the few, however, as you finished with a great score and almost a top 10 finish. Keep up the good work."

I find myself coming back to the gold star, probably because it is near the center, and the colour is brighter than the rest.

The other one was too dark, and less sharp overall. Great shot."

  "My first impression is that this a wonderfully different photograph and I am surprised it finished with a sub 6 score. The city is incredibly sharp, and the way you have compared the lights in the city to the stars in the sky is a lovely comparison. The framing is great (rule of thirds used), and the exposure seems just right. I really don't have any constructive criticism to give. This photo is a gem in the rough. Great work."

 "747251.jpg": [
  "Very good subject for the challenge, but the photo is kind of a poor snapshot.  The blank sky is the biggest problem, I think.  Composition could be improved in post-processing by correcting the tilt (making a straight horizon line).",

  "While there are a lot of OOF areas in this image, I just find them to be a little bit too busy. I find myself hunting for other shapes and trying to make out what could be back there rather than enjoying the viewing pleasure of your subject. You might have considered taking out that purple flowery thing in front too... a good subject is usually alone in it's splendor. Your colour scheme is very very eye pleasing though. This idea has a lot of potential. My suggestion is to re-shoot it with some of the above suggestions in mind so you can see what kind of difference it makes. Good luck! :)"

  "My first impression is that they look like hands coming out of the snow. They look like a burried person trying to get out of the cold. The style reminds me of Tim Burton's \"A Nightmare Before Christmas\". I like the simplicity of this photograph, and the amount of negative space you have chosen. The detail in the snow is just perfect, and the plant all by itself balances the photograph nicely. I really don't have anything to add in terms of improvement. Great shot. I'm not surprised it finished so high."

  "Such a beautiful image. The subject and background compliment each other perfectly, not only with the color being the same, but also the way that the bokeh circles in the background match the circles on the ornament, *and* the variations in lightness and darkness within both elements.  This cohesiveness makes for a very stunning image.  To nitpick, I would have prefered even more symmetry to go with the symmetry I have already mentioned: the top of the ornament is not perfectly straight-on (it's a horrible nitpick, really) and I would have enjoyed a square crop for symmetry which would also have gotten rid of the slightly distracting blur on the bottom left of the image.  But these, as I said, are nitpicks, which came to mind only because the rest of the image is absolutely perfect."

 "746940.jpg": [
  "I really like clean and simple photographs, so my first impression is that this is great. I like the sharp contrast in black & white tones, and the texture of the wire is interesting to look at. This is a different type of personification that most entries in this challenge. Many people have used inanimate objects and posed them to give them a personality, while you have created (or found) a person made from an inanimate object. While it is a nice photo, there isn't a cleverness as seen in some of the other photos, and therefore it doesn't hold my interest for very long. Perhaps seeing the statue up close and personal in real life would be a little more interesting."

  "Hello Tess. Congrats on your first entry and welcome to DPC. Overall, you did well for your first challenge. This happened to be one of my favorite shots in the challenge due to what I see as a strong composition. You used the tree to provide framing for the ornament, but left room to display the bokeh. However, I scored this a 5. The ornament is the subject based on your composition, and would have benefited by more DOF to increase the crispness of the orb. It appears that you focused on the most anterior portion of the orb, as the remaining portion is quite soft. The downside to more depth of field would be less bokeh, so I think the focus should have been further back on the right side. I hope this is clear! I love the light, white balance, and color, although the orb could be brighter. The bokeh works for me, although the bright portions take the eye away from the orb and dominate the photograph. If the orb was bright and in focus, it would not have taken a back seat to the blown out bokeh. Finally, I like the warmth that you captured. One last thing, in your editing steps you did not mention sharpening...unsharp mask, or it's equivalent, is very important to bring most digitally captured photographs to life.",

A beautiful subject (wise choice to do a self portrait here) I love the composition, the pose, the expression, the subtlety  of the before/after transition, the question of who/what you are looking at, and the pure black negative space.  While some suggest going a bit brighter, which might also look nice, this is fine just as it is--reminds me of the old school masters and the dramatic contrast style they favored."

The first thing I would do to improve this photograph, is to include the thermoter in the crop, as opposed to having it's reflection. Right now, you are showing 1/4 object and 3/4 object's reflection. If you reversed this ratio, the composition would be easier to understand.",

In your details you mentioned difficulty getting \"everything\" in to focus. The main dish is clearly the focal point, and there is a subtle blurring of the surrounding dishes in the back but not in the right third. I happen to like this, but if the goal was to have everything sharp, then a smaller aperture would have helped. Areas of improvement...lighting. As mentioned below, I agree that the white balance is off, as it appears to have a heavy yellow cast which is easily fixed in post. Overall, I like the composition and perspective. Looks delicious!"

It also helps convey the feel of touch - that the feathers of this bird are silky soft. I love the bold soft reds that color the otherwise muted scene. It is the splash of red that automatically draws our eye. My only critique is that I wish that it was a tad brighter overall so that the back half of the bird is not so dark compared to the sunlight front."

If the before and after of your image relates to botany, and/or the transformation of the flower, not everyone will understand the message you are trying to explain because it is a specialiazed knowledge."

Reminds me that most all iconography was commissioned and purposed to glorify god and how that probably isn't the case any more, in this case. Would be interested to know if that was true or not, but I suspect it is."

I like looking at photos of space (though not looked at that many) and I guess all the ones I've seen of space and deep space just don't seem as crisp and clear as this, take that as a compliment if this is actually a space photo and you have some great kit! So I guess I'm saying it doesn't quite look real because it's too clear! If it is actually a real space shot then I am way off the mark and I'm sorry! I'll check back after the challenge to see your notes!"

 "743229.jpg": [
  "Yes, a wonderful face. A little shred of time, deftly caught by you.  The noise does not obscure interesting detail, & adds to the impact. The BW tones & general appearance remind me of those old-timey collodion photographs made directly on glass.  I would never guess it was a reflection in window glass. Well done!"

 ],
 "743058.jpg": [
  "Great macro of a spider and what looks like a leaf. The subject is great, and the lighting is even better, how it reflects off the water. I especially like the dimples created by the feet. However, the focus is a bit soft for my likings. This is a small subject, with great detail and should be shown as such. But then again, it could be my monitor. 6"

 "742742.jpg": [
  "Another nice subject.  You do have a nice eye.  Here, though, I find a problem I have seen a lot which is cropping so tightly the subject can't breathe.  Now, I don't know what is not seen and sometimes you are forced to crop, but here I would like some negative space on some side.  Personally I almost always prefer the space on the left, but different picture work differently."

  "I know the last thing I want after eating some delicious okonomiyaki is to have someone taking a photo of me.  Your subject is fantastically captured.  If there is anyway to crop him without the food (cropping), I think the photo would be much stronger overall.  He almost looks like the okonomiyaki Grinch. 7",
  "He'd snapped the photo before he even realized his subject had noticed him. When he got it home, and saw that the man had been staring at him, he got an uneasy feeling.  Suddenly, small nagging memories hit him. The way the man had suddenly glowered, the way his head nodded almost imperceptibly.  It had occurred on a subconscious level for the photographer, something he hadn't been aware of but could recall in stark clarity now that he gazed at the photo on his screen.",

 "999757.jpg": [
  "I like the processing very much...overall a good shot.  The subject is less compelling to me than if I could see where the sap is being drained...Perhaps it's just having the protective hood over it which hides the typical \"view\" I would expect to see."

 "999717.jpg": [
  "I confess. I suck at portraits. It's to do with engagement and making the subject feel comfortable which I am sorely lacking. . I'd rather do paparazzi candids form 2 blocks away :) It doesn't stop me from enjoying professional work such as this and understanding the experience needed in both the genre and the use of light. The touch of light on her cheek, the sombre pensive look, the matching and complimentary clothing, hat and BG are wonderful. Natural light or strobes?"

It's hard enough to find such a willing subject, let alone to have one actually pose for you so gracefully.  Kudos on one of my favorite entries in this challenge.  Awesome work!"
 ],
 "999590.jpg": [
  "Love the movement! Winds must have been howling looking at the angle! I like a good vignette. Here, I don't think the vignette really serves to create a focal point because it is a little thin and a bit too dark in the corners. It is tough because of the position of the subject in the frame. It would probably be best left off here or maybe a little lighter."

Many of the other abstracts I have taken for this side challenge I was drawn to because of some accidental resemblance to actual artist work, but this one I just like the loose, but chaotic, order of the pattern of the subject - which literally was a pile of sticks."

  "I'm very accepting of minimalist shots with tons of negative space normally, but I can't help but feel like is this somewhat lazy, both in terms of subject and composition. The centered comp doesn't work here, for me, and giving more context of the flying bird might have greatly strengthened things, for me anyway."

  "Positives: Emotive title and an image processed in a way that conveys it is doing its best to hang onto reality - that resonance with the subject is well made and appropriate. The eyes are stunning - they anchor the image and offer depth to photo and subject. Of course, the motion blur is the most significant choice you've made in your capture - such foresight.",

  "First impression was wondering what the story behind the shot was. After reading the title and noticing the pink shirts... This is different and it catches your attention. The ladies are in a canoe, but their posture does not indicate they are paddling. Normally ladies are well-kempt, but these ladies are not. Nor does it look like they are at the end of a race or competition. The shot eliminates all the obvious answers as to what this is about, until you realize this is probably a moment of remembrance for those who were not survivors. Then this becomes a very poignant and precious moment. Yes, some pictures are worth 1000 words. This one exceeds that by a fair bit."

  "Perfect subject for Magic & Mystery: Harry Potter:-) The idea and effort is good but there are some things that could have been done to strengthen the visual appeal of the imagery. First, is position and arrangement of elements. It is good but can be even better. If you made the book larger to dominate the bottom right corner and then had the bird pages fly off to the top left corner you would have the visual interest of a diagonal 'leading line' for the eye to follow. Stars are a nice touch for it invokes the idea of magic being cast. The pages flying out of the book like birds are both a strength and weakness. Strength, because it adds visual interest and shows the pages magically taking flight. Weakness, because they appear flat & glaringly stark with no shadows or shading to give the illusion that they are there and not just pasted in. The pages should have words or printing on them but again they are stark white making it harder to believe that they are 'there' in the scene. Taking some shots with printed pages and correct lighting in 'v' formation to mimic the motion of flight and position from the book would have helped the composition greatly."

  "2) It's a cat photo. People hate cats (not me!). I think the root of that hate for pet photos in general is abundance because of convenience. It doesn't show much effort usually. People want to know you worked hard. You hiked for 5 hours up the tallest mountain, you got up at 2am to drive to a far away obscure place to watch the sun rise, etc. You see a ton of pet photos, because it's \"easy\". You've got to stand out somehow, which is tough. Looks like you were standing in your kitchen. Didn't even bother to change out of your pj's and slippers. Maybe even shot one handed while holding a cup of cocoa while your poor kitty was stuck outside. You cruel human! Hm, I've gone too far maybe...",
  "The impression I am getting here is disengagement/indifference from the cat, you can see the eyes but it's not looking at you. Only the nose looks in focus, and shooting through a window is always tricky.  The crop looks really tight too, I feel constrained.  The colours look fairly drab in the first place and the pp honestly doesn't seem to have helped.",
  "It's a reasonable cat portrait, but there is just nothing about it to make it special. I feel like 99% of the cat pictures I take turn out similar to this. I am not saying that you placed fairly in the rankings, but don't feel like this really deserved a lot more than it got either. With subjects like pets, kids, things we really care about, it's easier to think that the picture we took is better than the photo really is, because we have such an emotional attachment to the subject itself. Perhaps this is the case here. Again, I want to say its a good shot, there is just nothing to make it great."

The subject is dressed all in white (white being symbolic for purity) and looks the picture of innocence. But the title reveals all is not so. Lighting on the subject is soft complimenting the soft nature of the fur and also invoking the thought this lady is a soft/gentile creature...akin to a swan (I sometimes think Swan Lake and the woman in the frame is a ballerina) While there is an overall softness to the image to give that sense of dainty/gentile nature, I still at times hunger for more detail in the hair and lashes (processing seems that it has been smoothed)"

I'd likely have seen it square.  But you saw it primarily as a photograph, not as a subject or a portrait, and so you made it horizontal.  Which is ironic, given the fact of his silence, because it's the format that gives the picture voice.  The presence of the pillar of darkness on the quiet side of the picture, which many sad souls might say was 'distracting' and had nothing to do with the portrait, actually IS the portrait.  It IS a picture of darkness and light, both literally and figuratively, and that could not have happened any other way but yours.  One of the few really good, enduring pictures at DPC.  Thank you."

  "For me, this picture is too plain; there's too much \"empty space\" consumed by the lawn, and the house itself is in strong shadow and very contrasty. This would have been a good subject for an HDR exposure (take multiple photos a few EV stops apart in exposure, then combine via HDR tone mapping). You can download a trial of Photomatix Pro from their website if you'd like to try your hand at HDR."

And don't worry about the scores; they just prove especially in this case that the voters have eyes of cloth.   No point trying to please the capricious DPC voters, so shoot and enter what is true to you and your vision."

  "Impressive. Cambodia? I am a bit divided about this image. In order to find this moving, I need to think of myself walking surrounded by this amazing architecture and surroundings, in the silence, stopping by to examine the countless statues and details, to look at the looming trees and shade my face from the sun spearing them. To stop and reflect on how long silence came quietly living there, filling everything. The image evokes all of this with a certain effort on my part, and the help of countless documentaries and my very own memories. Perhaps not a defect of the image, but of the subject matter. Very good job in the B&W processing and framing."

I use my camera voyeuristically all the time (flowers almost give you no other choice), but I have never PP w/that in mind. What an idea."

I do like the texture that the mosaic generates in your background, but there's just something missing from the image. Maybe it's a story...or a general direction. When I look at it, my eyes aren't directed anywhere. In fact, the arms of Jesus tend to draw my eyes out the top of the image. I think a harder look at the subject would generate a more compelling image."

My favorite thing about this snapshot is how it follows nearly every fundamental of good photography, the level horizon, the rule of thirds, and not to mention this very interesting human interaction taking place.

I wonder if making the image a bit brighter by increasing luminosity or playing around with the channels mixer could have improved contrast without excessive posterization. If the intention was to capture the urban environment as well, posing the subject in slow shutter speed in front of the passing cars could have worked quite well."

Given the choice of going for high detail all over the image, I feel the out of focus little finger is a bit out of place. To be honest, this kind of processing and contrast are well over the top for my taste, but that's just my taste, I am sure many will love it.",
  "Sorry for my jadedness, the processing on this photo is a bit cliche, even if it does get good votes. The portrait would be more engaging if two things were done- have subject look at the camera, and less telephoto compression (shoot with a wider angle lens, such as 50mm or 35mm full-frame equivalent, but from a closer distance)."

And the sheer distance from your subject makes it just too small, unless you cropped way in, which might not have been feasible."

  "Nice interpretation of the theme. I feel the whole picture is a little lopsided. I want to grab the glass to stop it from sliding off the table :-). Since the main subject of the photo are the cookies AND the milk, perhaps the focus should have been on both, or maybe have the milk prominently as the backdrop without having the black chair there as well. Maybe a different colour table top would have made this composition more intersting and the green decor on the plate is unnecessary as it doesn't add anything to the picture"

If you look at the top shot, for example, that's an image that conveys emotion, and a very special moment that fits the subject perfectly, and it just happens to be a dog.  People may say \"Well, people like dog shots because they're cute.\"  I would beg to disagree, and I think you'd disagree too.  People hate dog shots, because they represent a few things:"

Also the Background is a nice smooth soft non distracting background which really make your subject pop. The border even adds a nice touch to it.",

Great contrast and levels too."

  "Not sure about this. While the three tones work well (very bright boats, very dark sea and midtone land/sky) the image lacks of definition and the framing is very static. I think cropping out most of the image left of the boat would give more the impression of directing home, particularly if the vassel was actually oriented more towards the shore. The blotchiness of the image is a bit of a let down. Challenge and basic editing aside, I think it would work better blurring the image and adding quite a lot of fake analog grain in photoshop or some other software."

But the title of the challenge is ambiguous enough to make it about foliage in general which makes this image a perfect fit. I like the light and darkness in the image and the clouds show great movement and lead my eye right to the foliage on the tree which is silhouetted nicely showing off good detail."

 "982740.jpg": [
  "I think it would have benefitted from underexposing a bit to keep texture on the leaves and grass, if the idea was to suggest a relation between musician and autumn. But perhaps there are not enough leaves or other autumn related elements close to the subject to stress the concept. Aprroaching the guy and convincing him to sit under an oak tree and pose for a real portrait maybe would have been a good idea."

That might work better with a recognizable singer.  Even still, a close up shot showing emotion, or 'putting it all in' with corresponding light, would do much better in my opinion.",
  "Nice pose and capture. I do take a flexible approach about the theme and in general I will rate a suggestive or impressive photo high, even if it doesnt't quite fit the theme. However, in this case I really feel like saying 'this is not a candid' :) Perhaps, aside of a direct portrait, a picture of a performer in action is just the anthytesis of a candid. I say this not as a criticism but to point out that there are is always a public side and an inner side to a performer on stage, and I have seen real candids taken at performances. An angry or worried glance because one of the other performers is out of time or because of some technical problem, a spontaneous smile between musicians which is obviosiously not intended for the audience. Backstage and end of concert moments. Perhaps, even at that specific event there were a few moments showing more of what the artist is and less of what he wants to show to the audience."

Sadly other people don`t have that connection with your subject and thus its sadly overlooked. Thats probably why this shot scored badly - to most voters who spend no more than 4 or 5 seconds on a shot - this is a shot of your kid messing around shoehorned into the challenge - and they scored it as such."

You've left a bit of a halo around the kid too, I'm assuming you were burning the background and didn't take the tool close enough to the outline of the child. Don't think it needed that since the background is too small an area and uninteresting to detract from your main subject. It's a cute moment though, a 5 from me.",

Another was to place a subject close up in the frame and fill the background with that typical street view. I think you have attempted the second method here. You used the tea and water glasses as  your close up but the focus is really on the ladies in the background. You did great with the gritty and edgy processing here though and captured a fine street scene."

If you lined up with the grids on the right side as it appears might be the case, you would have been better off aligning with the building instead. :) It's advanced, so this could have been straightened. I like the subject matter, but think a crop of some of the right and a bit off the top, leaving the open window may help this. This would produce more of a rule of thirds composition for your subject matter (the people) and perhaps add a bit more interest. ;) Would love to see this revisited (if possible) at a different time of day."

  "It is a good lens but I dont think it is worth the money. A friend has the 2.8 equivalent and the images are amazing. Sadly there is no way I can afford such a lens except in my dreams. My 12-24 is okay if you keep it parallel to the subject otherwise the distortion goes wild. This was shot with the lens pressed flat against the glass so it was easy to avoid tilt distortion. Lol the windows were for the most part not too bad but I did have to move around to find a relatively cleanish spot. Those windows don't open luckily and I would be too scared of falling out to do so even if they did",

I assume that this was taken in a fully sunny day with a lot of light, I'd really like to see you take this shot again on a cloudy day to allow a lot more contrast without blowing out the colors."
 ],
 "967140.jpg": [
  "Composition: Obviously you have some prominent red stripes on the box, so, there is no mistaking that you met the challenge literally. The first thing that hits the viewer is that the subject box is right out in front, filling up much of the frame, in direct very bright flash, strobe or other light. Although that might make for clarity if you were photographing say a surgery, or a cooking technique, it does not afford the viewers eyes a chance to relax at all. Its like- baboom! big red striped box right up front. this is emphasized by the very harsh shadow to the right of the box."

  "Congratulations on your ribbon and PB score! This was my top pic (I actually voted for a change), although I must admit my choice was based not only on the excellent execution of the image but also on the subject of the image; I've got a soft spot for chocolate ;-)"
 ],
 "964204.jpg": [
  "I think this would be improved if most of the long hair was cropped out & there was more negative space that the subject could look into.  Love the soft lighting & the focus."

 "964179.jpg": [
  "Good subject for the challenge."

  "Coming back to leave comments now. Lovely presentation of this tasty appetizer. Love the design on the plate for it adds a nod to this being an italian recipe. Lighting on the subject is lovely and the colors really pop. My critiques are small but I feel it would have made this even more mouthwatering. The bread looks a little too dry and toasty - visually it makes me want to reach out for the bottle of olive oil that I am sure that is just out of sight of the composition. Don't get me wrong a good crisp crunchy bread is good but with a dash of olive oil when toasted or after will make it taste divine. It may have had that olive oil added to the bread but don't 'see' any evidence of that - if that is the case then pulling back a bit to include an attractive bottle of olive and maybe a pepper shaker in the background bokeh style would have added some punch to the shot. The other critique is that the basil doesn't look 100% tip top fresh - the edges of the cut basil look bruised with the deeper green edges - it looks like it has had time to sit and either absorb the juices from the tomatoes or it shows the bruising after x amount of time after cutting. It is still fresh but just not '30 seconds straight out from the kitchen prepared fresh'. Still a simple, tasty, and well presented snack that garners an 8."

  "Love this, more bowl and table or closer to subject and dof 9"

 "964115.jpg": [
  "I realise that the subject as opposed to my technique was the real winner here, the foreground was a problem for me too, but i never thought to put my 480ex on. Due to the heavy spray the original photo was a little white and washed out, so i bumped the curves and saturation. I had put the camera on spot metering because the breakwall (the boxes with the straps!) kept on exposing ok but blowing out the waves completely."
 ],
 "964075.jpg": [
  "What an amazing macro. The subject is striking, and the execution is flawless."
 ],
 "964077.jpg": [
  "I love the colors, but the cropping seems gratuitously tight. A bit more room for the subject to breath would have helped."
 ],
 "964079.jpg": [
  "A staple in my house. Probably eat them almost weekly. So I am connecting well with your subject from a foodie perspective. From a photography perspective it is a bit lacking. Snapshot feel to it, cropped way too tight. I think you could have been a bit more creative with the image. Would gladly take an invite to come over and dine with you though."
 ],
 "964072.jpg": [
  "I love the original subject matter.  I'd be interested in hearing how you made the shot of what looks like one skyscrapper with a many faceted personality."
 ],
 "964055.jpg": [
  "Hmm the subject of this shot seems to be the tree, when I think you want the mansion?"
 ],
 "964029.jpg": [
  "I really like the way you filled the photo with your subject and used depth of field to your advantage."
 ],
 "963988.jpg": [
  "Just too many distracting elements for a monotone.  Dark shirt on subject is very distracting and background behind subject is too blown out."
 ],
 "963953.jpg": [
  "Better title \"Despair\".  Good lighting.  I'd \"flip\" the image horizontally so the subject is facing left and the viewer doesn't come into the photo to the back of his head."
 ],
 "963932.jpg": [
  "I'd flip this so the subject would be facing the other way so when my eyes come in from the left of the photo I wouldn't come into the back of her head.  Good composition with subject not dead center (good rule of thirds).  Clothing is very distracting... would have preferred a solid color dress with all the spots of color around the photo from the flowers.  Lighting is a bit harsh on the arms and face making subject look \"bigger\" which the patterned dress also does."
 ],
 "963902.jpg": [
  "Sorry but u r wrong for me. First the subject is nit the lady but the foot. How can the shadow distract you when u say that the foot is too big. The top right? Probably u have never been on a beach and that is giving u the sense of the deep. Again, women face is nit the subject, the subject is the foot and the title is very clear. Idea is brilliant composition is nice light was very strong, if u r off its because of your envy"
 ],
 "963897.jpg": [
  "I think that is much harder than finding a new subject to work with. Great work! A testament to patience.",
  "What is it with Squirrels. . .am I missing something. Well done shot, appreciate the subject matter relating to the challenge. . .which seems to not be happening much on this one."
 ],
 "963891.jpg": [
  "Interesting shot.  (the subject is centered, you might try a different composition)"

 "963872.jpg": [
  "A few general comments:"
 ],
 "963868.jpg": [
  "Awesome.  Great shot, editing, and the subject matter is fun as well."
 ],
 "963824.jpg": [
  "Was your subject primarily illuminated by a non-stationary light?"
 ],
 "963819.jpg": [
  "Excellent and unique subject matter while adhering to the challenge.  Crisp where it nees to be and flowing as well.  Thumbs up."
 ],
 "963817.jpg": [
  "Thought this looked like your style and subject matter. I was going to leave a guess, but was not certain enough of it. I like the play of light on the metal and the details are pleasing. Got a 7 from me.",
  "Fun subject and great colors!"
 ],
 "963814.jpg": [
  "Like the general tone of this image 8."
 ],
 "963811.jpg": [
  "MOVE the subject off dead center (review rule of thirds) and flip the image so the subject faces left so when the eye enters the photo from left it doesn't go into the back of subjects head.  NICE lighting, monotone color and effect."
 ],
 "963813.jpg": [
  "Well done example of using the effect to highlight your subject matter instead of being the subject itself."
 ],
 "963792.jpg": [
  "What great notes!! I never would have though of covering up my subject for half of the shot. I would have thought of anchoring the light to get a good arc. etc, etc. Fascinating reading, and thanks for sharing!!"
 ],
 "963643.jpg": [
  "Way too cool! I wish it had a stronger subject than just the light rays - I vaguely remember seeing a similar shot on 1x but with a stonger subject, though I can't find it now. Still, my favorite in this challenge, and I hope it ribbons blue."
 ],
 "963630.jpg": [
  "Do we have Topaz software? LOL.  Neat effect.  Suggestion... always look past your main subject to see what is distracting in the background.  It's almost like the white cardboard menu in the background is growing out of his hand and the lights at top growing out of his hat."
 ],
 "963619.jpg": [
  "the flash on the subject distracts me from an otherwise great concept and execution."
 ],
 "963600.jpg": [
  "I agree this is really sharp, the subject is perfectly separated from the rest, nice."
 ],
 "963585.jpg": [
  "Interesting subject matter.  Implies a story of cyborg pelicans coming to the city, discussing their plans to take over the world.  My only nitpick (and this might sound incredibly nitpicky) is if you angled it ever so slightly more, so the slight shadow line on the right edge of the picture on the water is cropped out, it would give the water a greater sense of three-dimensionality and give the pelicans a greater sense of space in relation to the bridge."
 ],
 "963545.jpg": [
  "i think a little to bright or overexposed, but the subject is great"
 ],
 "963532.jpg": [
  "I honestly thought this would finish in the top 10. It's a lovely photo, with an interesting subject, and an unconventional edit that makes it unique. Keep shooting this kind of subject and keep exploring edits that convey an interesting perspective."
 ],
 "963502.jpg": [
  "While I'd consider this image to be on the right side of the bell curve for portraits, for me to bump it up any higher, I would need to see something more than just a beautiful, technically sounds visual representation of the subject at a specific point in time.  I want to see some kind of story, some kind of deeper insight into the subject.  Basically, I think this is a great image, but I know what kind of talent lurks beneath the surface of the photographers on DPC, and I want to push that talent to its limit : )"
 ],
 "963445.jpg": [
  "I believe these are leaves? The impression is strong that they're knives. The strong contrast plays up this illusion."
 ],
 "963330.jpg": [
  "Unusual subject for the challenge,always a good thing."
 ],
 "963270.jpg": [
  "Interesting... would be better with less void at bottom and needs to be a landscape format not vertical.  Too subject is too dead centered"
 ],
 "963263.jpg": [
  "Not totally in love or anything, but ... well, I do like it - this could just be really nice on a wall.  Good POV, and eclectic subject matter."
 ],
 "963199.jpg": [
  "No strong subject to look at (clouds just weren't enough to pull my eyes.)"
 ],
 "963200.jpg": [
  "The subject is nicely placed but I'm just wishing the horizon wasn't in the middle of the photo for this challenge.  Like the lighting."
 ],
 "963073.jpg": [
  "not sure about the subject and cropping to bring it into focus would help 9"
 ],
 "963040.jpg": [
  "Normally I don't believe it is necessary to plop the subject on a set of crosshairs, but this is different. I love the humor and always like lego creations."
 ],
 "962896.jpg": [
  "This is a very good subject for pattern. I think the shot is just too literal. It is docmentary. Try different perspectives and angles to really accentuate the architectural pattern to the viewer."
 ],
 "962822.jpg": [
  "Love the subject and the very appropriate duo tone effect."
 ],
 "962811.jpg": [
  "Initially unconsidered reaction would be it?? a bit too dark but at the same time washed out without the blacks being quite bold enough.  The appearance suggests to me that burning and dodging seems a bit overcooked (I?? more than guilty of doing that myself) but not enough to make the main subject of the image leap out at you.  Possibly all it needs is a quick boost on the contrast?  Composition is also a bit off in my mind; feels a bit inverted (not the word I?? looking for)."
 ],
 "962810.jpg": [
  "Perfect subject matter for monochrome. A range of tones and textures. Fun to look at too."
 ],
 "962791.jpg": [
  "Like the subject but the processing leans a little too far into cartoonishness for my taste."
 ],
 "962769.jpg": [
  "Magnificent. Very interesting subject and wonderful pp"
 ],
 "962751.jpg": [
  "I see you in your red shirt.  Good subject matter."
 ],
 "962741.jpg": [
  "Not really what I would classify a macro, more a \"closeup\", I mean, you got the whole subject in the frame, just like a headshot is to me a closeup but a picture of someones eye would be a macro to me.  Not a bad shot though so I gave it a 5."
 ],
 "962738.jpg": [
  "I might have picked a different subject for the technique, like an old car or someone dressed in old style clothes."
 ],
 "962685.jpg": [
  "The eye has to be blurred since the main subject is the ear.  But...the sharpness should have been on the ear then IMHO.  Your point of sharpness looks to be placed just before and below the ear.  Now, the ear being part of a baby, I suppose baby couldn't sit still."
 ],
 "962641.jpg": [
  "Common subject with a bit of a difference,I like it."
 ],
 "962614.jpg": [
  "You can see that some photographers are friends/partners when they - almost - always choose the same subject.  Fun is to see how they approach the subject in a different way and - somehow - create their own \"inter-relatives-challenge\" :)"
 ],
 "962602.jpg": [
  "Amazing effect! It really gives the impression of a \"wavy\" floor. I would have used the full size allowed (800 pixels longest dimension)."
 ],
 "962594.jpg": [
  "A strong subject with a creamy background. The eye is fabulous and captures all the attention. Very nice!"
 ],
 "962590.jpg": [
  "horizon line and subject both very close to center.  great capture and execution of challenge concept.  gl"
 ],
 "962522.jpg": [
  "Cool subject that works very well with the slight sepia-like colors."
 ],
 "962403.jpg": [
  "Love the technique not the subject 8"
 ],
 "962344.jpg": [
  "I  battle with the same problem you do. I can't get close up enough and when I do the enlargement, away is the sharpness. Very good subject and colours. I did not enter that is why I can comment freely.7"
 ],
 "962331.jpg": [
  "Not really what I would classify a macro, more a \"closeup\", I mean, you got the whole subject in the frame, just like a headshot is to me a closeup but a picture of someones eye would be a macro to me.  Not a bad shot though so I gave it a 5."

  "Ben does have a knack for using water for the purposes of subject isolation in an unexpected way. This captures some of that. Beautiful."
 ],
 "962288.jpg": [
  "I love the subject isolation here -- how the line between water and sky is blurred."
 ],
 "962244.jpg": [
  "Terrific image.  The subject is strong enough to dissipate the clutter behind him, although I'd have preferred less clutter.  Gorgeous pp'ing."
 ],
 "962217.jpg": [
  "Grit, the play of light, and the near miss of the apparent subject create the balance and tension that is Ben's."
 ],
 "962214.jpg": [
  "A classic good shot. In the style of Ben? Perhaps not exactly. Save for the subject and the sky. But a fine photograph."
 ],
 "962218.jpg": [
  "Fantastic subject isolation. The bokeh is hypnotic."
 ],
 "962147.jpg": [
  "Great use of negative space, dramatic image, though the subject and style do not remind me of Ben's work.",
  "Fabulous use of negative space and subject isolation. And strangely disturbing."
 ],
 "962129.jpg": [
  "Textures and thirds. A pleasing composition. Intriguing subject matter. Nice black and white conversion. It's all there."
 ],
 "962140.jpg": [
  "Love the empty space, ant the balance you achieved by placing the subject so far into the corner."
 ],
 "962098.jpg": [
  "I did something very similar at an airport last year. Table as tripod? I do like how your subject is isolated against the busy goings-on."
 ],
 "961991.jpg": [
  "Here's an interesting and unexpeted sort of candid. A little more troubling than the sugary portraits of Ben's girls we're used to seeing. That's not a criticism of either -- rather both build their magic based on what the subject and scene have to offer. I should add that I rather like the faded (desaturated) tones in this."
 ],
 "961950.jpg": [
  "I am giving you my best score for this challenge. Your image is well lighted, sharp, and colorful. Your subject is nicely placed in the frame and is interesting to look at. Great job"
 ],
 "961947.jpg": [
  "love it. you have a hidden subject and one in the fore front. well placed and such",
  "Pulled out the whole collection huh? :)  This is a fun still life approach to the subject for sure!"
 ],
 "961943.jpg": [
  "Belated Happy Birthday to the subject - hope it was a good one."
 ],
 "961918.jpg": [
  "nice color. But subject needs to be bigger"
 ],
 "961893.jpg": [
  "with this type of contest everyone is going to do a macro. What sets one apart is adherence to photography rules. Your subject looks accidentally hidden, but it is well placed in the frame."
 ],
 "961896.jpg": [
  "Initially I thought this was a little too colourful, but the more I look at it the more I like it. Nice shot. Love the eyes. Great 'teeth' too. I think the iridescence gives the impression that it's out of focus even though it's not. That probably hit you in a few votes."
 ],
 "961881.jpg": [
  "Excellent image.  Perfect composition... subject and execution are very Ben.  Well done."
 ],
 "961870.jpg": [
  "humorous. This one is set apart from the others because your main subject is implied and explicit like in others."
 ],
 "961867.jpg": [
  "subject needs to be larger"
 ],
 "961842.jpg": [
  "nice contrast make sure your subject takes up more of the picture next time"
 ],
 "961795.jpg": [
  "The subject is great - seems like there should be a bit more contrast, and sharper focus on the bugs.",
  "Here is why I'm scoring this low....The subject is not in focus / sharp.  The image is not well exposed (i.e. lower right corner is the brightest spot of the image which naturally draws the eyes away from subject), the composition is poor (subjects centered in frame and frame is cluttered...green leaves in particular are VERY distracting). Please take this as constructive criticism.  3 from me."
 ],
 "961779.jpg": [
  "Is this  ? I like the softness and tones in this image. I feel it would work better if the subject was moving a bit, but it's still a lovely shot."
 ],
 "961722.jpg": [
  "The blur coupled with the tight framing makes this very disorienting. My first impression was that it feels too accidental, but it's kind of growing on me."
 ],
 "961508.jpg": [
  "I really like this.  The distant, sharp subject against such nice blues."
 ],
 "961510.jpg": [
  "This doesn't seem far away, but DMNC aside, the subject is not in focus. Well, two of its legs are, but I'm not feeling it's enough to save this image."
 ],
 "961448.jpg": [
  "Love the DOF on the subject fly and wings!  Gross, but still impressed by the DOF on the beast!"
 ],
 "961447.jpg": [
  "This is such an old fashion image. The subject is someone out of an adventure novel. Terrific capture, and I really like the sepia tone."
 ],
 "961434.jpg": [
  "Sorry, but putting something in the title doesn't make it the subject.  The subject pretty clearly is the rock and spray.  Aside from that, though, I think the vertical orientation detracts from the power of the water.  A wide view would grab me more."
 ],
 "961430.jpg": [
  "WOW!!! Such a fabulous entry.... subject colors sharpness - it's all there!!!"
 ],
 "961391.jpg": [
  "I very nearly speed voted on this image but it made me stop, i initially didn't like it and was about to give the dreaded 5 but there is something about this image i really like, i can't put my finger on it, it could be the vivid colours, the scowl of the subject, the surreal look or the general lighting, whatever it is i really like it."
 ],
 "961394.jpg": [
  "Wonderful flower, but the subject is bug.  I need to see more bug that beautiful flower."
 ],
 "961358.jpg": [
  "the thing with bugs is color. Black and white does not work so well especially when your subject is not big with lots of contrast."
 ],
 "961351.jpg": [
  "Nice subject but lost in the darkness to me"
 ],
 "961337.jpg": [
  "Sweet subject with great lighting, but the cropping off of his fingers hurts the image. Everything from the direction of his hands to the line of his closed eye and his lower lip lead the viewer's eye to the point where his fingers touch the fountain, and that isn't in the frame."
 ],
 "961334.jpg": [
  "Don't know why you're surprised - this is a great shot!  (I'm a bit biased based on the subject matter, but I still think it's a great shot.)"
 ],
 "961323.jpg": [
  "Theres one thing that bugs me about this shot, it looks like you've used the blur tool, but only half the tree is blurred. Your main subject is very nice and I love the scarey looking clouds!"
 ],
 "961307.jpg": [
  "Interesting choice of subject. I have to wonder if you are getting low votes due to the most stand-out subject material is the closest."
 ],
 "961219.jpg": [
  "the berries are distracting from your subject"
 ],
 "961204.jpg": [
  "I like this shot. Great DOF, subject in sharp focus especially head, eyes and there is details available at highlight . Only 2 things should be improve, the background noise, clone out dirt around the stick and unwanted white spot around wings. cheers!"
 ],
 "961164.jpg": [
  "My first impression was that this image is over saturated but in this particular image it looks OK. The simplicity of the composition is great but not particularly original. The sky adds a lot of interest. Overall a nice image but short of being great. Maybe overlaying short exposure of the boat over the long exposure with smoothed out waves would turn a nice image into a great image."
 ],
 "961165.jpg": [
  "I love the contrast of the subject to the rest of the frame. The clarity of this shot is very nice."
 ],
 "961159.jpg": [
  "I like the movement of this image.  The contrast of the white foam with the harsh shadows of the rocks on the sand.  Never the less, when I look at this image- I'm wondering what the primary subject its.  The rock? The water?  I guess I'm just wanting a more pronounced point of focus."
 ],
 "960866.jpg": [
  "Would have preferred more sharpness on the little bugger and less on the heart of the flower, which seems to be the main subject of your photograph now.",
  "I think the subject is bug not flower, so focus on the subject nest time and I'll give you above a 2  Update: for your not so nice personal comment to me I just lowered your score to a \"ONE\" now I am a really bad ass ain't I.  :)"
 ],
 "960797.jpg": [
  "Nice choice of subject and setting. Though I like it in colour I think this image could be great in black and white. That patch in the sky is slightly distracting. I imagine that's an effort to scrub away an overexposed sky but maybe a gradient would work better."
 ],
 "960787.jpg": [
  "Welllllllll, Leroy, it seems many of us had the same impression that she was looking for a bathroom.  Contrary to your comment in the scores thread, I don't think that makes any of us \"sick.\"",
  "I am not making fun, but my first impression was that she had to urinate...I don't see the distance aspect..."
 ],
 "960738.jpg": [
  "This is an interesting photo, as the girl on the bike actually seemed to become the subject to this photo instead of the power station. I think it's the pink pants that stick out among the washed out colors. I think this could have been more powerful if you were on the other side of the path."
 ],
 "960665.jpg": [
  "The skyline is a tad overexposed which distracts and the subject is just plain boring but I guess the title helps explain things."
 ],
 "960661.jpg": [
  "A bit too dark for my taste and the subject could be larger in the frame."
 ],
 "960569.jpg": [
  "Pretty cool and weird at the same time. This image somehow creates the impression that the girls are running backwards and then forwards in perpetual motion. Just like a film clip that is fast reversed and fast forwarded continuously. Hup hup Holland!"
 ],
 "960562.jpg": [
  "I jus don't like the main subject to be out of focus."
 ],
 "960554.jpg": [
  "Oh, I like this!! Great subject matter and I love all of the elements."
 ],
 "960515.jpg": [
  "I like the framing of the trees and the composition. Something I have learnt on DPC is that it generally scores better if the subject is a bit lighter than the surroundings because the eye is drawn towards lighter objects. Your sky is a little too bright and maybe takes some of the emphasis off of the person. I do understand that the scene you photographed is quite difficult especially under basic editing because of the bright sky and also the darker shadows. Keep it up - I see potential!"
 ],
 "960375.jpg": [
  "Great image and the desat is perfect for the subject IMO."
 ],
 "960350.jpg": [
  "Great subject but i think a little more detail in the sky would help. Still scored highly though :)"
 ],
 "960152.jpg": [
  "The central subject is perfect with a capital \"P\" thanks for sharing your vision."
 ],
 "959874.jpg": [
  "Great picture. You really used the challenge subject and put it into a story. Well done and very creative! 10 for me!!!! (I would be interested in your setup for this picture!)"
 ],
 "959822.jpg": [
  "Very good cover. I'm glad you chose a subject that many would be scared to tackle for this challenge."
 ],
 "959820.jpg": [
  "A long story here. But good photos are subject of good pondering."
 ],
 "959794.jpg": [
  "Overall a nice interactive moment. The general exposure and saturation is really good, but shutter speed a bit slow as the front foal's head appears blurry as it walks away. The rear hedge looks like the hand of man, planted, trimmed, cut back from time to time. What story am I being told here by NG? A great experience to witness these beautiful deer up close but there needs to be something more polished to speak to me in the way NG has done for readers."
 ],
 "959705.jpg": [
  "Love the sense of scale here.  Really got me to think about the subject with this image!"
 ],
 "959688.jpg": [
  "We are not worthy! Superb image with exasperating detail. Love the framing. The BG is extremely well handled (It's in a zoo right? Not unusual for NG) and lets the main subject pop in 3D reality. Perhaps this was achieved in PP or merely with superb exposure technique. i.e. -0.5 EV. Be wary if submitting to NG if you have PP the image. Publishable? Definitely. Perhaps a tiny bit more crispness on the head, beak and eyes but overall, high marks. 10."
 ],
 "959612.jpg": [
  "Although a plain subject you've made it very inviteing, I love pix like this that make me want to jump into that place! Very Nice!!"
 ],
 "959559.jpg": [
  "good subject and a 'N.G.' border!"
 ],
 "959466.jpg": [
  "It's not the main subject in the photo, and in the overall scene it does blend in too much."
 ],
 "959461.jpg": [
  "Your main subject has his back to us and the surrounding action is relegated to the margins and further obscured by unnecesary vignetting. With all of this working against the image, it's hard for the viewer to pick up the storyline."
 ],
 "959452.jpg": [
  "I guess it's a criticism you might have anticipated, but I don't like where the subject is looking. I don't feel engaged with him at all."
 ],
 "959447.jpg": [
  "Common waterfowl are hard subject with which to do something that stands out as different, but I think you nailed this one. Wonderful shallow DOF and pleasing pastels.",
  "Nice tones, subject isolation."
 ],
 "959438.jpg": [
  "I'm not finding myself terribly captivated by this image, I think due to subject matter, and the \"from above\" perspective isn't really dramatic enough of a shift to bring me into the scene. The black and white helps, but I think what I really want is to see the face of the person leading the boat, and maybe a slower speed to show the motion (I know, it'd be killed here by the other voters, but it would be more 'true' to the title)."
 ],
 "959422.jpg": [
  "I love this photo! Great subject matter and colour. I can easily imagine seeing it in the pages of NG."
 ],
 "959396.jpg": [
  "I like the subject matter but the focus needs to be better on the eyes, the colour just isn't reaching me and I'd like to see the top of the mane too please."
 ],
 "959394.jpg": [
  "Great subject for this challenge.  IMO, the lighting needs to bring out more detail all the way through the image to look more like a magazine shot."
 ],

  "Odd location, and it could be used in a story about the cities underground, quite a flavour of the month in television atm. I just feel that an urban explorer replete with mining helmet, a rope and a torch ala Indiana Jones needs to be in this image. i.e. The human subject of the article should be in this image to complete it, make it more engaging."

NG also tend to name the subject in question, by common and scientific names or at least give some explanation about the shot. It's unlikely this image would be published unless it's a one of a kind, never seen before bird, and this is the only picture they got of it deep in some Amazonian jungle."

 "959044.jpg": [
  "I think the photo is very good with a hard edged contrast and deep saturated colors. One thing that could be changed is the background. It is dark and busy with lots of textures that overpower and hide the subject somewhat. I would prefer a more grey urban background or something plain and simple."

 "959010.jpg": [
  "Interesting choice of subject for this challenge.  You managed to make it low key, which, of course, you had to for this challenge, but it makes me think there should be something else out there that the sunflower is just barely illuminating ... or something that hints at why a normally bright and cheery flower isn't.  If that makes sense ;-)"

 "958811.jpg": [
  "In this image the subject matter appears to be the electrical meters, possibly because they are in the brightest part of the image. The right side and upper left is a dark void, which my eye finds impossible to rest upon. I do, however, really like the added grain/noise. It suits the colors."

You funnel the viewer's eyes perfectly to the end of the train track...I just wish there was a strong subject we were being directed to. I'm not bothered by the grain...there's a vintage feel to the photograph which is great."

  "Very interesting creative effect and use of texture in this one. The abstract nature of it is throwing me off though. I keep trying to read the text and finding that it doesn't seem to relate to the subject of vodka. The highlights in the foil (?) are drawing my eyes away from the outline."

  "This is a beautiful- creamy blue shot.  With the subject only filling up the middle 1/5 th of the image, I can't help but feel like a tighter crop would make a stronger statement. While this is pretty to look at, this doesn't really make me want to drink Absolut. It's not outstanding for me.."

  "I really like this photograph. It's very peaceful...the way the horizon flows and suddenly becomes clear in the reflection in the glass (yet it still undulates like a wave in the reflection). I'm glad you used a border...I'm not being thrown out of the image in any way despite the fact that your subject is partially out of the frame."

 "957948.jpg": [
  "I like your creativity here a lot. I'm not completely sure if I understand the connection between vodka and eggs...but you created a very pleasing image. I also have to say excellent culinary skills with this one! Good use of the frying pan to pull your viewer's eyes to the subject also. I wish the background related more to the subject though. Perhaps using the stove and the lines and circles of the burner to direct the viewer's eyes to the pan and complement the shape of the pan also?"
 ],
 "957926.jpg": [
  "Nice tones and interesting subject and angle."

 "957915.jpg": [
  "You made the impression of a liftoff very well. I wish the color gradient was a bit smoother though (there's such an abrupt change from orange to red). Your focus is spot on and the sharpness is very good on the logo. Even though the angle is down, you give the impression of power in this. Well done."

 "957736.jpg": [
  "A nice idea but i thought the backround subject could have been a bit more interesting ( pastoral to me gives thoughts of cows meadows etc). would it have made an interesting shot without the cutout in front? also the wonky martini glass kept drawing my eye, guess im a little autistic!"
 ],
 "957678.jpg": [
  "My first impression is that the horizon is centered awkwardly or at least a strong line of the dam, - but the color wins you over- the slight purples in the fore, the cobalt above- the candy corn floating rocks in the purple shimmer with gold, the buildings add intrigue and as does the setting sun. This is one of my favorites."
 ],
 "957633.jpg": [
  "What a wonderful crazy image.  Your eyes can wander all over it and see so many interesting shapes. However it is not obvious to me that this could not be handheld, as there are no clues at all to the subject or technique used."

  "I really like this photo. I wish you would have had a different title though. When I first viewed the image, I had the impression that this was a larger aerial shot and the push pins were actually bottles of vodka! You did a good job with the shape of the bottle...but I'm not sure what push pins have to do with vodka? Your design is very uniform and well done though."
 ],
 "957292.jpg": [
  "Your sensor was in competition with the subject for who would produce the most interesting \"grain\". It actually has a feeling of a found still life, rather than a fossil at home. Well done."

  "Gorgeous scene. I'm not really feeling the vignetting. It seems to take attention away from the subject in this case."

  "Nice HDR, I can never get a subject to stand totaly still! modle gets and 8 also!"
 ],
 "957023.jpg": [
  "Very nice work, my favorite of the lot. I love your use of blur on the trees to create the impression of depth. Watch out for light direction though: if the moon is supposed to be the main (only?) source, the trees on the right should be totally dark. Not a big deal of course :-)"

 "956987.jpg": [
  "I like the way you used the subject simultaneously as the frame.  Nice prop placement."
 ],
 "956964.jpg": [
  "Strikes me as the work of Clive. Textured subject and light, fleeting glimpses of past and current beauty. I particularly like the black hat/whatever it is at the top of the frame. A well chosen, and placed, concept of aging. Hanging over our heads to be embraced or futily battled. The dark eyes suggest the one time beauty queen has failed to accept this gracefully. No mercy in tyranny. 10"
 ],
 "956734.jpg": [
  "I am not a fan of the vignetting. I believe this would have been a much stronger \"more Calendar like\" photo if it had been on a pure white background. That being said, the subject is absolutely adorable"
 ],
 "956702.jpg": [
  "This is one of those where a title helps convey how it suits the topic. An engine parts manufacturer might certainly have a calendar portraying such locations. Far more interesting to look at every day than closeups of seals and bearings. Judging from the subject and treatment I'm going to hazard a guess that this entry could be from  ."
 ],
 "956698.jpg": [
  "My opinion on how you might make this photo better is having the bug the main subject rather than the bug/flower as the main subject."
 ],
 "956676.jpg": [
  "Top page is my guess this will end up. Stunning! I love the reflections!  Very clear and crisp. I read in a magazine once that an image like this where the main subject on the right is less appealing than if it were flipped and the main subject was on the right. Just a thought you can try out if you plan on going back to edit this a bit more."

 "956655.jpg": [
  "Nice car! I have always liked the \"moving people\" photos with a main subject sitting still. And black and white works very well."

  "Great effect, I like the way you have of pushing the subject to the very edge, you always do it successfully."
 ],
 "956535.jpg": [
  "Not sure if the voters will be nice to this one. The photo although has a main subject and nice bokeh in the background seems a bit flat. There is no real \"pop\" to the photo to keep the eyes happy. Just my thought though."
 ],
 "956541.jpg": [
  "Obviously a beautiful shot.  It almost looks like a jewelery ad. But the subject matter is not what comes to mind when I think of a 'still life' shot."
 ],
 "956323.jpg": [
  "I think I would have cropped some from the top and the left to off-set the subject and emphasize the leading lines.  I love the texture on the walls and the ground, and I love the way the light shines off them."
 ],
 "956322.jpg": [
  "So much potential just misses. The excess space around the subject really diminishes its impact as does its slightly off-centered comp. Possible remedy: crops off both sides and comp centered on the tip of his nose. I wanted to give a 9 for beautiful tones and the purest silhouette in the challenge, but sorry just a 7."

 "956288.jpg": [
  "I absolutely love the curve along the side of the image, but the subject matter just doesn't do it for me."

 "956258.jpg": [
  "I wish the subject was a little closer in the frame.  I really had no idea what i was looking at until I read the title."
 ],
 "956198.jpg": [
  "Really gives the feeling of loneliness here. Future possibilities include having the subject sitting near a window might have added some interest to the scene. (Just so you know, I am not judging the elements of the photograph that are not present.)"

 "956163.jpg": [
  "You did such a great job getting the steel wool ring centered on your subject... then you put the subject slightly off center?? Why?"

 "956125.jpg": [
  "I don't get a feeling of night time from this. Although I do find ants to be interesting subject matters, this one feels a bit shoehorned in there."

  "Okay i think you hit the zenith on this type of subject matter."
 ],
 "956019.jpg": [
  "Wow, another beauty. Sometimes I get the impression you live in a tree. The reflections are superb. Actually, the person's shadow in the foreground looks like an electric guitar body and so does the main whiter reflection on the path with the people up to being the tuning pegs (kind of)."

 "955980.jpg": [
  "How fascinating - in your picture my first impression was that the clouds dwarfed the landscape (instead of thinking that you had a different POV)"

  "The leaf doesn't seem to be in focus, and honey is not the main subject here, I think."
 ],
 "955906.jpg": [
  "Wonderful processing. The tones are vibrant without being too saturated. I think the compo could be improved though, the centered subject is fighting with the tree in the right for attention and it builds some confusion in the image. Overall a great image."

  "The sky certainly looks gorgeous in this image. I feel like your subject could be sharper, but if you had a long exposure, I can see how this would be hard, especially with a person just 'standing' there waiting for the time to pass."
 ],
 "955479.jpg": [
  "This is a nice capture that is very well exposed. Compositionally, there doesn't seem to be any real subject to the scene. What are you trying to show me about this landscape. It seems to be all background with no real focal point. You got a fairly rich color in the sky. One thing that could have helped would be to use a polarizer. It might have cleared up the murky water."

 "955458.jpg": [
  "It is a great moment, the bee appears not focused..i would personally crop it closer to the subject as the green appear a bit distracting"
 ],
 "955428.jpg": [
  "I wonder if you could have recomposed to put the subject in the right hand third of the image. I see the mountain range in the background on the left with the tip of the branch pointing right to it. It might have made for a stronger composition. Everything else was done well. I don't mind that this appears a hair dark."

And this makes it very difficult for me to vote. The dog is definetly not lighter than air but it is suspended. So it does match and it doesn't. Therefore I'll vote on the quality of the picture only."

  "I don't see a subject here to capture my attention.  My eye goes first to the large hay bale in the foreground but then quickly goes to other areas in the image but doesn't find anything to rest upon.

  "Positives: I do like the swirly blur here - it makes me feel that I am somewhat out of phase with the world I am seeing. I think that's an accomplishment to shift the sense of blur and movement away from the subject and onto us. I'm particularly fond of the building behind and the hints of the wider world so revealed."

  "Personally, with this photo I think the contrast is just fine and added to the appeal of the HCB challenge. Your black point is in a good place when looking at the shadows and his shoes, you can see detail in his jeans and the whites oh his shirt have some detail in the creases etc. I think much more contrast would have brought out elements in the brick such as the patch job to his left that would have been a bit of distraction. As is your subject popped from the background and there is certainly still enough detail in the building/wall behind him to make it pleasing. It helps make it more of a \"period\" shot in my opinion. Congrats."

I think you can play on the rule of thirds or even placing your main subject in one corner to heighten their importance and call our attention to them more. Here they seem to be swimming in the stands and my eye roams looking for where the anchor point is and can stay. I think it would significantly strengthen the shot if you had the crop where the men are in the bottom left corner and then we see all the seats open and empty 'radiating' out and away from them. Of the two shots this has much more potential with being a strong composition."

When I saw that it had won, I looked at it with new eyes and started to appreciate the technical expertise required to shoot the photo and began to realize the power of the photo. It conveys it's subject extremely well, so well that I still don't like the photo! If I can ever take a photo that is half as powerful as this I will be happy.",

  "(Not voting) It wasn't until I began looking at this on the laptop which is brighter that I now see that the two girls on the left are laying flowers on a gravestone. My first impression upon seeing it on the PC (in which both far right and far left are cast in darker shadows) was that it was the two girls on the left were playing and excluding the girl to the far right. My thought was that the action of excluding the little girl was sad - even though I could not see/read her expression because it is dark and in shadow. Now I can see that the two girls are paying respect to a loved one who has passed - the problem still rests in that facial expressions and the tombstone that is flush with the ground are too lost in the shadows to convey a  sense of sadness - there is a touch of sadness but it is hidden by the deep shadows that fall on the opposite sides of the photo right where they need to be visible the most. Since this was Advanced editing you could have done a little dodging and brighten up the areas on the girl's faces (but not too much) and a little more on the left side so the graveside is a bit more visible."

  "Why this images works for me, I like the black and how it surrounds the figure.  Along with the posture of your subject help to portay emotion.  when I look at this I feel as though the figure is alone, and that is very sad.",
  "I like the use of negative space in that the small rectangle room of the main subject seems to be swallowed by the darkness. The figure sits with the shoulders slumped and head down which is another visual indicator of sadness. The outlook is bleak the man despondent - he is surrounded by darkness. While a good shot showing sadness there are a few things that could make this an even stronger photo. First off as much as I love the meaning and impact of the negative space it is a tad too much. Cropping a bit more off the bottom to have the man and the room dominate the bottom right corner of the photo would give a bit more impact to the darkness having him \"cornered\". Next is that the B&W tones of the man and the room are flat - more greys than a dynamic range of highlights, midtones and shadows. I think if you play a bit more with brightness/contrast, highlights/midtones/shadows and a little dodge and burn to make the areas that should be tending more in white tones instead of shades of grey (shower tiles, sink, lesser degree the toilet). The man has some nice light falling on his shoulders, arms, and head but because the tones of his backdrop a more grey he does not \"pop\" visually. Having more dynamic tones in the room and the man would make them visually stand out more and thus take more commanding presence in the darkness that threatens to swallow them. (not voting)"

  "Well I had been hoping that it would crack a 6, not surprised with the score based on the subject and some of the all around great images in the challenge.  Don't think it deserved the 1's but it seems like there are always a few to go around.  I got my first top twenty finish and first favorite ever so those are positives."
 ],
 "946450.jpg": [
  "There is definite pain, suffering and sadness in this image. I can see the tears and the expression of pain in the eyes and the way the subject holds their mouth. To me it is palpable. The other thing I really think is a strength is that you only show us half the face - the message to me is that the subject is trying to hide their pain and suffering. Youth tries to hide what they are feeling inside - and I feel that this half face shows the true feeling of what is behind the mask. This is the half that is typically hidden; what we don't see. I almost feel like I walked into the room and interrupted/intruded on a private moment- that the main subject quickly looked up in surprise that someone walked in when they needed to cry it out. Nicely done. (not voting)"

 "946289.jpg": [
  "It terms of meeting the challenge - I'm not sure that this is the best match; I suppose I had expectations that the subject would stand out from the background as a consequence of its colour. Here, the constant colour across the frame has the opposite effect - though I do concede that excellent edging provides some much need contrast."
 ],
 "946283.jpg": [
  "Great subject wonderful tones and very well lit. The only knock is the missed focus. I can imagine this with crisp fur and it could really sing, it looks a touch back focused. I love the way the light bounces around in the folds of the dog's face, but I miss the textures that should be there."

Some users like   can manage to make things and objects very interesting but do so with careful planned lighting and extraordinarily well executed pre and post technicals."

  "Positives: I like unusual portraits and although I'm not sure I like this one (see below), I really admire the work here. Bold as you like subject and composition, I love the POV and how it goes up, up and over the top - almost backwards it seems; without seeming to be distorted. Confounding and slitly amazing. I really like the jaundiced coloration too and of course the story."

  "It's a wonderfully creative idea and a brilliantly executed image. Congratz with a well deserved Blue. Just one little observation. You should have also mulled/roughed up the sand from behind your feet to the waters edge and also roughed up the sand on your back and around your head and chest to create an even stronger and more convincing impression that you just swam up the beach."

 "945720.jpg": [
  "However, I do feel the need to call you out on this part. The challenge description stated that the image should be \"comprised of primarily warm colors\", not that the subject should be warm in relation to the surroundings. But, I have a feeling that you let your dislike of the image cloud your judgement on that.  Personally, I felt that I not only met the challenge, but that I met it threefold, by combining actual warm colors with warm skin, with a somewhat \"sinful\" activity (associated with Hell).",
  "P.U. is right.  What an abhorrent shot.  Mixing the model with a real or implied religious setting is downright offensive (and not in a good way).  And since the main subject is not \"warm\" in relation to the orange fabric, it DNMC.  Tasteless, truly tasteless."

  "I would say, yes, the sky was blown out. I wouldn't say that's a complete problem though. The overall scene, however, is a little on the bright side. Of course your subject is properly exposed but everything else is a little over exposed. Judging from the shadow it appears you were shooting into the sun. If possible I would shoot from the other direction so you have the sun behind you."

 "945371.jpg": [
  "Thank you, Janine!  I used all 3 extension tubes hooked up together.  I always take the lens hood off when I use these tubes because when I use the tubes I get even closer to my subject that I normally would.  It takes some time getting used to them and in my experience a little harder to focus with them on than without them, but they provide amazing results on tiny subjects."

  "This could tell a story.  It could be an example of social commentary of the day.  Fine art?  I'm not so sure.  But as I struggle with so many of these images, I realize how subjective this whole subject is.  I think I'll stick with my first gut reaction. 6 I like how the light above the roof of the doorway mimics the light on the guy's head and arms.  Almost like the same shape as the doorway in miniature."

I don't get the sense that you chose this subject because you're passonate about it, but because you felt you can do something cute/clever with it. That's the path to creating a good commercial image not fine art."

 "945168.jpg": [
  "I would have given this a higher score (gave it a 6) if it was brighter. but i think that the subject is nice and the general idea for editing was great."

 ],
 "945083.jpg": [
  "a unique subject with great tones and light",
  "I've come back to this several times.  Fine art?  Hmmmm not sure, but that is so subjective.  I think it speaks of our society in general and if that is commentary and makes us think, then art it is.  I'm thinking contemporary more than 'fine' if that makes any sense at all."

 "945058.jpg": [
  "This is the first image I've come across where I feel it is \"art\".  I have no idea how to explain why, but there you have it.  Glorious and engaging, full of textures and tones (and a cat).  I have no idea how you did this, with the textures overlapping the subject - and pray it isn't an overlay!!!!  A fave.  Just gorgeous."

 "944662.jpg": [
  "First impression:  I liked the slightly out of the box thinking using this subject for this challenge.  I can see some may have considered it to be not meeting the challenge, but it works for me in that context.",
  "However, what doesn't really work for me is the composition.  I feel, however much effort you put into the arranging of the cards, they are just carelessly thrown and then photographed - at least this is my impression.  In other words, the best has not been made of the subject material."

 "944600.jpg": [
  "Thx for the comments i will work on my B&W conversion and exposure. I will also try next time to get the main subject to draw more attention by cropping or different angle.",
  "The middle is murky, and the subject is ill-defined. I can't tell what I am supposed to be looking at, and nothing in the frame really leads me to anything. The flowers are the dominant thing in the frame, but they lack the detail to keep my eye."

 "944584.jpg": [

 "944536.jpg": [
  "Poor thing is missing a few legs.  Harsh photo, but somehow suits the subject matter.  I'd prefer more of a background/environment, but that's a personal taste kinda thing."
 ],
 "944533.jpg": [
  "I don't remember the image in voting which suggest I did a drive by. Perhaps that's the issue.... Picking this up as a critique comment, like the Free Study comment series I do, forces you to stop and think but in general voting, especially in a large challenge, a visual hook to keep people long enough becomes important."
 ],
 "944531.jpg": [
  "I think this is an exceptional image. Wonderful tones, bags of story and an intriguing compositional balance. I really like your use of negative space here and how your subject stares blankly into it. I also like how the image is black on the left, white on the right and grey in the centre - perhaps a visual clue that some choices aren't black and white and that the considered action may lead to a 'grey' outcome."
 ],
 "944485.jpg": [
  "Hate the yin-yang symbol in general (there is not good in evil and evil in good -- God is good and there is no evil in Him).  However, subject aside, this will ribbon.  Lots of setup and well shot.  The dark chips are a little too dark, but otherwise, nice lighting too."

 ],
 "944415.jpg": [
  "Again... I'm forced to echo the comments pertaining to the hands. Such a great defining subject matter. Not just any hands would do for this, and the awkward and craned pinkie really just do it perfectly. I also like how it is aligned with the black frame, and also that there is a frame that serves as a demarcation between her and her subject matter. They are segregated by time, by space, by many things. Great."
 ],
 "944394.jpg": [
  "Overall, although this is competent work, there isn't a huge amount of intrinsic interest in the scene and such your choice of subject probably placed a cap on the maximum score this would pull in."
 ],
 "944291.jpg": [
  "I like the way you have depicted what can be a fairly common subject by making it appear to be slightly abstract.  I think the very heavy blacks in your post processing have done this.  I have to say, I rather like this as it is, but can imagine there are some voters who would have preferred to see a bit more detail in the shadow area and so this probably contributes to the score."
 ],
 "944232.jpg": [
  "A very well done pic.  The roses draw the eye into the main subject of the pic and the monotone works well."
 ],
 "944233.jpg": [
  "Your aspect ratio and consequent placement of main subject is eclectic, that can work but for me I think that's best done if you can balance the composition with some compelling features in the space so created. You've pulled off elements of that - the succession of graves pulling us into the image with the communication of depth. I think your choice of depth of field works against you, making it difficult to make this very effective though, the 'SIMS' letters are apparent enough to catch our attention yet out of focus enough to frustrate. Tonally, this is quite flat - I don't know what editing tools you have available to you but I think a boost in contrast or the addition of a carefully constructed vignette would have helped to create some drama.",
  "When I look at an image, I like to see a photographic footprint - evidence of the choices the photographer has made and to be able to appreciate the benefits of those choices. Here, the placement of the angel does reflect a clear choice (so I like that) but it hasn't left me with an impression that the choice was effective."

Interesting subject, and well captured. It's nicely in focus. Sharp. And black and white suits this quite well and encourages texturing--definitely suits the criteria of the challenge. No question in my book."

  "I really like your contrast and subject here.  Nicly done!"
 ],
 "944116.jpg": [
  "I think that the title along with your photo is an artistic statement on the state of manhood and on being a modern husband in the western world. In our modern female dominated culture, manhood has been kicked to the back of the bus... and don't dare speak your mind about the subject or risk being labeled a wussy who can't take it or just the opposite, a woman hating oppressor. All in all, manliness is missing from our culture today!"

  "I think I might've made it less of a square and cropped off some of the area at top and bottom. I like the subject matter but to me, it seems a bit \"floating\" with so much negative space around the woman and her cute pooch. Or maybe if they weren't centered.  Hope this is helpful. :) 6"

 "943976.jpg": [
  "Comment is part of the 5 versus 6 comment thread, a very good subject well found, but not well executed.  Looks out of focus to me, plus to add to the drama I'd have a used a wider angle lens."
 ],
 "943889.jpg": [
  "Of story I can't comment, because I don't connect with subject matter like this generally.  Perhaps many people are in the same boat.  For me, content is as important as form, or at least my interpretation of it is, and I always like to feel something about the photographer in images.  I don't get that experience here."
 ],
 "943818.jpg": [
  "As for the main subject (a thorn bush of some kind?) it is an interesting subject. I think it was probably your intention and I think it works for moodiness (but probably not for scoring) but it is basically only black and white with no greys. This makes it stand out from the background quite well, but what it does not do is show you details on the bud (is that what it is?). It looks like a spikey black ball with white streaks in it. Again, I personally think this works but I think the more common DPC voter appreciates detail and mid-tones more than cut-out blacks and moodiness."

I guess this is another example that subject matter counts for a lot for the 2 second voters of DPC (the majority of voters i would gather).

 ],
 "943656.jpg": [
  "Nice shot!  It doesn't capture some of what I think is the best of Weston's sense of form, though there is more to his work (I love it when he captures a subject with notable depth that is conspicuously flattened thus abstracted with his capture -- I think your subject was too flat to start with to recreate that).  With that in mind, I think the contrast, lighting, framing, and spirit of your shot are spot on.  I really like it."
 ],
 "943603.jpg": [
  "I like that you forsake Weston's bw.  Sadly I don't think it helps.  This is a nice shot, I really sense emotion from the subject and feel like I can identify with how she feels somehow.  I think this kind of empathy is conspicuously missing from Weston's work (my opinion).  So, I think it misses the Weston style, but is a great shot!"
 ],
 "943600.jpg": [

 "943328.jpg": [
  "The texture is fantastic.  Based on my read of Weston though, I don't think this hits it.  I think Weston is more obsessed by form, motion, and tends towards the abstract.  There is practically an X in the center of a circle on this subject at your angle, the form does not suggest motion at all, and the subject does not come off as abstract.  Instead it is very matter of fact.  Doing a cross section or pulling off a leaf and shooting more tightly cropped I think would really help."

 "943295.jpg": [
  "For me, your ability to capture the texture, temperature, and tone of a subject is breathtaking.",
  "Positives: Superb use of a shallow DOF and even better use of SEP2 (am I right - the burn pattern and toning are suggestive of that). The subject matter is most compelling too; the springs with their own form extruding from the fabric below. It all begs the question as to where this mattress (if that's what it is) is.... the very information we are denied through your low DOF technique."
 ],
 "943290.jpg": [
  "oddly enough, I feel too biased to keep bumping up this photo, even though I can't really say that I know you or the subject. It's to your credit that I feel like I know both. The photograph is sKul(p)tur ... marble... you have evoked the cold eye of Weston perhaps better than anyone else. Like Weston, you have chosen not to \"freeze a moment in time\" but rather to turn your subject into stone... of course you still deal in eternity."

 ],
 "943199.jpg": [
  "Awesome.  At first I thought it was a gourd, but now I'm thinking it's a swan digging in the water.  That reaction alone I think demonstrates a great recreation of Weston's approach.  I especially like that your subject is so different from what I have seen him do.  That said I think your shot has too much depth with the back being out of focus.  Still, I really like it."
 ],
 "943089.jpg": [
  "So..  the image-  Proper Weston crop; slightly high contrast.  In fact, when I think of his peppers they beg for personification.  And so does this cat.  This is a well executed cat portrait in the style of Weston.  Not necessarily his subject matter.  Oh, and too bad for me...  I really don't like cats.  Terrible allergies.  But I can't help but bump this one up on my second look.  Good luck!"

 "943062.jpg": [
  "Ultimately, though, I think what had the largest effect on your score was the sky and the fashion with which the areas get blown. They are simply very distracting, they battle the subject for primacy, and this is very anti-Weston. I would like to note, however, that (in my opinion) the relative \u203bWeston-ness\u00a7 of entries was not really correlated to score (consider the top entry, a hallmark of romanticism).  Whilst you may not know as a new DPC member, blown areas, and particularly areas blown with little reason, are a oft hated photographic element, and those areas in your are quite distracting, in any challenge. You\uff0ave shown quite some Chutzpah in entering this challenge as your first, as the prompt had many scratching their heads quizzically, so I hope you stick around and keep at things. This wasn\uff0at an easy challenge to score in, not least importantly because the voters didn\uff0at really know how to vote it."

 "942849.jpg": [
  "The subject isn't captured in what I think is a Weston way.  Instead of being slightly puzzled by form being flattened almost to abstract, this just looks like a gorgeous shot of flowers.  Having the entire subject(s) in focus would really help, but I think you need to look at your subject differently.  Perhaps where the flower on the left meets the stem would have more promise in my opinion."

 "942836.jpg": [

  "Seriously - 4th place - how can I possibly give you any constructive criticism? The clarity and the BW tones of this image are outstanding. You said yourself that the crop is a little different than Weston, however, I feel it works for your subject really well. The hairs near the artichoke heart are a bit blown, but clearly, that affected nothing. I think it actually adds visual interest by creating contrast to the darker bottom part of the image.",
  "Yes.  I love the contrast, lighting, perspective, and framing.  I just think you show too much of the subject making it too easy to identify right away.  The dark area towards the bottom of the subject provides a secondary and contrasting focal point that makes it feel like too much is going on, especially for a Weston."

  "In a free study, I might have given this photo a 5 or possibly a 6 depending on how I felt on that particular day :)  I believe that your execution of this image was exactly what you wanted it to be, so you accomplished that part.  As for appealing to me, the viewer, I'm not finding a personal connection or appeal in the subject or composition.  If I was judging the photo on technical qualities alone, I would score it higher, but in my opinion, technicals are just a small part of photographic art.  The subject choice and the photographer's approach to that subject is 85-90% of the goal.  What this means from me is that there are a lot of photographs out there that are technically poor in some people's eyes that strike me as fantastic images.  If the subject and theme of the image overwhelm me, the technicals don't seem to matter so much.  When a photographer manages to captivate me with the subject and approach AND managed to be right on target in the realm of technical achievement, it's a sure winner in my book :)"

I do think your contrast range, lighting, framing, and presentation of form really echo his work well.  I especially like that your subject is so different while capturing his approach so well.  Awesome!"

 "942573.jpg": [
  "I really love the idea of the piece and the general feel with the matching pastel pinks throughout the image. However, the turny thing (lol, sorry I don't know what its called) is far too obviously made out of cardboard, and that really brings the image down in my opinion. I would have made the inside edges smoother, or at the very least tried to smooth it out in photoshop. Anyways, besides that its a great idea and really well executed. 6"

  "The subject as such would have been great for Weston. I love that cracked hole in the front of the shell. However, the image is painfully out of focus. Also, there's a large black area at the top that is just empty space, so the composition could be tighter and better composed. That said, the BW tones are good."

 "942070.jpg": [
  "Neat shot.  I think bw was smart and really helps.  I love the head position and being able to see where the subject is looking.  The way this is cropped with extra space of the left really counter balances so well with the bird's position, angle, and wing position.  It almost feels like there is a string in the top left that the bird could be hanging on, swinging off to the right."
 ],
 "942004.jpg": [
  "Great shot.  It looks like the subject is smirking.  I love the sharp focus on the tail, back, and head with motion blur on the wings.  Bokeh is great in the background, though I wish the horizontal lines (especially the ones at the bottom) were level."
 ],
 "941999.jpg": [
  "The subject really jumps out."
 ],
 "941948.jpg": [
  "The topic was Focal Point, and in this case, it's obviously the tulip. The subject (tulip) is centered in the composition, and it fills most of the frame. Therefore, the eye is not lead through the image  the subject, which would be more desirable. Since there is no flow to the composition, the image appears somewhat static."
 ],
 "941933.jpg": [
  "Fitting title.  I love the subtle sunset hue in the sky.  Also cool to catch the moon in there.  Unfortunately the birds in flight that are supposed to the main subject didn't grab me.  Maybe the lazy birds on the ground (which are the ones best in focus at least because of no motion blur) provide the wrong kind of anchor.",
  "Well done. The scene in general is very cool, but the addition of the full moon really makes this a striking image."
 ],
 "941916.jpg": [
  "My only 10 in this challenge!  You nailed the theme.  This one works better than other images because your subject stands out in 2 ways.  Both due to depth of field and difference in color/shape.  Great work and good luck!"
 ],
 "941821.jpg": [
  "I love the idea here.  The pattern of the iridescence just turns out to be far to distracting and manufactured looking (perhaps because it was an aggressive crop on the original).  That said, I think I would have liked this much more if you just cropped this much more tightly around the bird.  The iridescence is just far too dominant and seems to be the subject of the photo."

I like the lighting and the bw conversion is really good too.  I also like the way the light isolates the tree and broken ice from the rest of the image, so for me, the pp'ing does a good job of isolating the subjects (which to me seem to be the foreground ice and tree).  The swirling sky is fabulous and definitely \"van gogh-ey\", and clearly not the subject.  Well done."

With the finger on her chin I imagine her to be a little mischievous elfin creature, trying to decide what tricks to play on the hapless humans next...I love the strangeness, the unusual lighting, even the tight crop. In general I am unmoved by baby pictures, so for me to love a baby picture is really saying something. But then I'm weird :-)"

  "At first glance I thought the figure was standing still, and the photo had a profound effect on me. On looking more closely I see that the figure is actually walking across the 'wasteland' and the image loses some of its power.  The photo that I  to see (with the figure standing stock still staring out of the back of the photo) is, perhaps, a statement about myself - a desire for the world to leave me alone, and yet at the same time an acknowledgment that such a solitary life would be intensely lonely to the point of pain.  Not often a photo can provoke such strong feelings within me, even if they are based partly on the first impression rather than the reality.",

Not sure it works entirely - to me the walls and other features seem as though they are receding into the distance, and I want to reach out and pull them closer.  I also find myself trying to define what various elements are - obviously not what you want with impressionism, and that may very well be a fault of mine as a viewer."

The runoff of the water flows over the edge and blends seamlessly into the clouds giving the strong impression that the clouds 'pour' out over into the valley from the mountain high.

 "935348.jpg": [
  "I like that you have your main subject dominating the left half of the frame. The buildings are composed in a leading line that draws us forward to see where this man is destined to walk. There is also the fade from dark tones (the man and building in the forefront) to the light tones (the end of the street, the vanishing point off in the distance). To me it is a subtle nod of mood that signals this man's thoughts or feelings: walking out of dark thoughts/sadness to happier thoughts/carefree. Tis a shame that the street does not go off into the distance for that brick wall muddies the strength of the mood created. Also there is an odd 'halo' sharpened effect that is most visible around the dark outline of the pants."

And I think that's worth an 8."

Unless it is a cloudy day try to avoid this time because it gives you harsh shadows. Go for in the morning or an hour or two before sunset. Great idea and I love the lines that the trees make."

More than the woman's expression which is a good capture in itself you have created a tangible impression of tension and story by the slight panning blur in the background and around the foreground woman's hair that oozes a sense of action or purpose in all the participants.  The woman behind with the bag has a strong effect drawing attention to the lady in the foreground.  This shot for me is a beauty!",
  "Nice capture! I took some lessons from you regarding proximity to subject and can see how you use the wider focus up close in this picture as well as the others you showed me. This deserved a much higher score. You did so well with the commenters votes. Would have been good for you to hear from those who were lower in their voting. I voted you a 6. The blur did not deter me from liking it. I thought it was slightly grey and lacked some contrast. You can pump it up in post for your collection!",

  "not sure where you are in your progress of learning photography, i know i already asked in the thread about your lighting. as far as this goes, its generally better to avoid wrinkles or folds in the b/g. this is not always possible depending on the workspace but moving the subject farther away from the b/g and opening up the aperature a bit will blur the b/g nicely, or perhaps blurring it in photoshop takes the attention of the b/g and puts it back on the subject where it belongs."

The lighting on and around the apple was rather harsh and detracted, as did the black semi-transparent blob at the top center of the picture.

There's little distinction between his shirt and the background and also the guitar and the background. I think that had a very negative impact on your score. This might have been avoided by using a different light setup or even a slightly lighter backdrop. (not white) I don't think white would have worked here either. There also seems to be some blur. That can sometimes be caused by a lighting issue or ISO. Good composition and good idea though. Happy shooting."

I don't mind the leaves hanging out on the right but the plant on the left is pretty distracting and really just not needed in the shot. It is obvious to me that it was a bright and sunny day....probably sometime midday...I have found that to be the hardest time to capture a pic with good lighting. For this particular scene I would say early morning or late afternoon. I would actually like to see this one revisited. Keep it up. Good luck and happy shooting"

Looking towards the left does not bother me at all. The problem I do notice is the bicycle. I think in the location it's in is a bit distracting. Mainly the handlebars by his head. I think it would have done much better if he was in front of the bike. I still think the bike is necessary for your shot....I just would have chosen a different location. Overall nice shot though.

Once that became clear the technical excellence became even more apparent. Amazing sharpness and detail, perfect strobe technique and spot on exposure. I don't think I can tell you a thing that would make it better, or would explain your lower end votes.

Good effort to capture this most unusual building."

The pastel hues and lack of a true black, take some of the brooding mystery of the subject matter and spill it away into the land of tone mapped blah. Sure you get all the details in the shadows, but you give up so much, including, I expect, the blue ribbon. Still my second favorite, but it could have been the clear winner."

I think the center part is distracting.....However the background has been blurred too much. It does make the totems look fake. I do have a good note though. I love the totems. There is plenty of detail. Also I like the touch of color in an otherwise b&w shot. I would like to see this one done again with the blur issue worked on. Don't let a few bad comments get you down though. Happy shooting.",

Blurry stuff in the foreground, subject is not the most focused thing in the shot, colors are rather drab, light is not interesting or directional, seems like buddha and sky may be a little overexposed...  yeah it's a tough crowd.  There are some other voters here who will applaud you if you dare to take risks in your shot or its processing, but that probably won't improve your score.  If this were mine, I might have tried for a mystical feel with some gaussian blur or glowy processing and more color saturation, and nonetheless landed at the same score ;-)  Learn all you can, but ultimately, make images to please yourself."

But I wanted to explain why I gave the score I did.  It feels like an HDR image.  May be single frame with the HDR adjustment applied.

It would also have improved it if your timing  had been such that the person, again to her right, could have been hidden. He is the main distraction but the 'midget' on her left shoulder doesn't help either. You could probably have used a lower ISO but I don't see any noise issues here anyway so its a throwaway observation really."

The contrast with mark wiley's essay could not be more apparent... it's the difference between unawareness and awareness. Mark gives us the peace of unconsciousness, you give us proud confrontation. There is a timeless quality to these photos. Any time in photographic history someone can be taken aside and photographed like this, but these are not \"posed\". Clearly, this is a respectful, honest interaction between two people, subject and photographer. You're on a fine line here, but you never lose your footing. They are aware enough to look you in the \"eye\" but not long enough to become self-conscious. The expressions are as varied as the people themselves, as though you've caught something essential about each person instead of having them act out your agenda."

Every type of energy has a drawback and a price to the environment and I am not convinced the payback is worth the cost for these.

The white irregular streak along the left suggests the impact of time in storage on an old printed image, adding another layer of thought. Much to consider, much to appreciate."

  "This is quite a favourite for me. First, it gave me sense of serenity yet loneliness. Looking further, it revealed a longing for identity and closure in a virtual sea of reflective uniformity. Yet there are significant subtle differences in those reflections. Nuances draw the viewer and subject into its\uff0a illusionary world with perhaps a false promise of discovery. There is a sense of falling into a nothing, a void while the search for identity remains as elusive as the implied unending multiple reflection. Facing this existential void may require extraordinary measures, leaps of faith with no promise of reward."

  "Ok... classic case of missed opportunity. This has so much potential in it and this rock has allot going for it. Dark mood and as the main theme in this image I would have composed - or cropped this slightly different. Not sure that the horizon in the middle helps this. Yes it was a dark and gloomy day but the processing lets it down a bit and I would have used a bit more contrast. I almost want to play with this image myself but this is your interpretation and the way you intended for viewers to judge it, yet it wont draw attention or interest as it stand here and you also are not putting enough emphasis on your main subject when you dont use all possible tools you have. A square crop is perfect for this but with horizon and other elements placed wrong you loose the plot."

Aside from being a perfect submission for this challenge, the texture of the wood against the negative space bokeh is most interesting because of the similar colors.

Showing that an image with negative space doesn't have to be a solid swatch of nothing surrounding a sharply captured subject in the thirds."

I like your low viewpoint which has allowed you to exclude potential distractions and isolate your subject against a plainer background.

 "1137688.jpg": [
  "You may stir up the anti-water drop crowd, but I think this is a very appropriate subject for this technique and well executed.  As a constructive critique/observation, the focal plane seems too tight for sharpness through many of the drops, so I wonder what something closer to f18 would have produced (or perhaps the focal plane wasn't parallel to the glass).  But on the other hand, having drops well out of the focal plane adds a different feel to the illusion of depth for this type of shot. Regardless, it works and I like your interpretation of the challenge."

  "There is some potential for improvement that I would like to talk about. First the illuminated trail is over-exposed with no detail remaining. There is a large area of similarly over-exposed area that is not related to the main subject and is detracting from the main subject. The whole image would benefit from less exposure to darken the scene down to allow us to concentrate on just that which is relevant to the scene. The scene itself is not contributing to the image at all, a more relevant scene would be preferable. Within this scene there are elements such as the post box on the left edge of frame that really should not be there at all. There is a distracting green streak of light on the house that detracts and should not be there."

 "1137243.jpg": [
  "I have to be honest my initial impression was negative until I saw the challenge you have entered it for and now I understand the reason for the processing, so with that in mind\uff03 The house is the only sharp feature in the image and therefore becomes a stronger focal point than I assume you wanted it to be. Personally I don't think it detracts especially given your title you want it to emphasise the buildings, as it does."

  "So intrigued I am by the orderliness, I actually found the meal secondary, but the clarity and the arrangement of the subject material within the frame is really quite impressive. Quite a fascinating glimpse into a very personal work space.  The incongruity of the food in such an organized space is a perfect response to this challenge.  Love the pedestal for the monitor - a ream of paper. Wish you well. Is that really rice with stuffing?"

 "1136458.jpg": [
  "I did a quick glance through your outtakes, and I agree that this is by far the best shot. It's an excellent example of breaking the centered subject rule and getting away with it. The composition is solid and interesting. Both man and pup seem to be having a great time. It's a great photo for this challenge, because their youthful, healthy energy shines through. I love shots that are taken from behind or silhouetted, because it allows the viewer to transport themselves into the scene. Sometimes when a human's face is included in a photo, it draws attention to itself and distracts from the real purpose. Great job."

I bet in 20 years I will have a memory of that image. Maybe not the exact image but how I remember seeing it. Your processing exaggerated the horror for me and I was horrified when I saw it-and I find it oddly comforting to realize not all of the horror in the world is instigated by humans-it is an integral part of our existence."

Unfortunately, that might also trigger memory of the specially flagged notice attached to this challenge: \"Extra rules apply to this challenge Shots of currently living  things may be disqualified\" (underline and bold added). Otherwise nicely detailed and interesting.",
  "I faced a voting dilemma on this image.  On one hand the main subject is clearly something that was once living, which doesn't meet the challenge criteria.  On the other hand, the subject is clearly no longer living and the spoon is inanimate....  What to do?  I compromised and decided to \"bend\" the rule (in my mind) for voting, because I think the overall image is well composed and has an interesting post processing texture to it."

  "Your choice of subject fills the brief in the respect that it is not animal, bug, etc but it could be construed to be animated in that there is action in the flow of the water itself so its possible that this may be reflected in your score.",
  "The image itself has limited appeal due to the shallow DOF and image noise but the subject itself is not really that interesting either. Given your settings you could have reduced the noise with ISO 3200 which would still have given you about 1/4000s plenty fast enough to stop the action. Perhaps a lower viewpoint may have enabled you to emphasise the flow as a peak against the level of the surrounding water but as it is it is just not that interesting, sorry."

  "A fairly interesting image in the way it isolates the word mute from the rest of the machinery through the shallow DOF but I find the dusty surface very distracting in a detrimental sort of way, its taking away from the subject which is not an amazingly absorbing subject in the first place. I do like the way the DOF is working here and the OOF elements, if anything an even wider aperture would have made more of the G8 less distinctive and isolated the mute word more effectively.",

This is a careful balance that's difficult to achieve in a photo essay.  Your photographs are beautiful and genuine.  By this, I mean no tricks or gimmicks were used to make this something it's not.  With a subject like this why would you want to.  Thanks"

I particularly like how you ended the story with a boy gazing at us through a reflection in the mirror. Maybe we just followed him around while he studied all the wreckage. It's certainly visual stimulating and makes a fine essay."

Here, the boat is exiting fast!  :-)  But it works.  I think the diagonal line of the wake is also helpful.  If this was shot where the boat was moving horizontal to you I don't think it would have the same impact."

  "Composition does have some separation into foreground, mid-ground, and background, but it is difficult to land on a particular subject of interest. The palms and vegetation could be interesting if showing more detail (maybe move closer and apply some sharpening in post processing). Mostly it seems a shame to enter such a small version in the first challenge to allow 1200 pixel sides. That will probably decrease the overall score."

Mind you, I haven't seen as many as I have of elephants, but even if I had I'm still sure that this one would remain the most \"Holy Mackerel!\" bit of drongophraphy ever. I'm so jealous that you made this beautiful photograph of such a difficult-to-do-justice-to bird that has seen me fail 100% of the time ... though all my efforts were with the African cousin, the fork-tailed drongo, which is probably a much more difficult subject than this Asian variant.  I'm lying; it's exactly the same.  Still, I hate you a bit..  But thank you; it's quite brilliant.  9 (at least)."

The horizon gives the impression of being slanted, even tho the bison looks level.  Either way it is a bit distracting.  Would have also preferred if you had submitted it at the new higher size, after a bunch of bigger images it is hard looking at the smaller image."

The close-up macro of the fly is excellent, I'm hoping to do as well with my new lenses on order. I personally think this is exaggerated, meaning too far from that vertical third line.  I could be wrong, I interpret the rule of thirds as the place to center the subject, and it looks like you've placed your subject completely within the top-right third box. I still give this a 6 for clarity, detail, and deep rich colors."

The plant is interesting, but even its use in the title doesn't convince me you can have a \"plant candid\".  Had you moved a little to the left and zoomed/cropped in on just his hands and the plant that would have worked as well, but it still plays as less of a \"candid\" shot.   Lots of background distractions take away from the subject."

Technically, your subject is nice and sharp, and I like the colors.  However the lighting feels just a bit flat and that odd line right at the tree line made me think that something was a bit off.

I'm also wondering if having the whole rod, rather than it having the tip cut-off might have made for a slightly stronger composition - or maybe the lens just wasn't quite wide enough to capture it all?"

I even see a bit of framing with the white edges, and that makes this feel like a complete image to me.  The image does feel a bit flat, like a flat object was photographed - which perhaps turned some voters off?  But you have a nice, abstract pattern of color going which also made the photo interesting to me."

I used to be pretty much against HDR treatments of photos because a lot of them were heavily overdone, but this is a good example of how it can be used to enhance a shot while still retaining photographic integrity.  (And again, I'm just assuming this is HDR.)",

It's great that you got that bird in flight as well.  Unfortunately, the sky is king in this photo, and while in other circumstances framing the bird or even the sun using the tree branches and the grasses would work well, with the sky as is it only serves to block more of what I want to see."

I also would like to see a bit of opening up in the shadows and highlights - the brightest spots are in the background at top of the frame and draws my attention away from the subject, while the detail of dino faces are lost in the shadows. The change in color temp (from different areas of the scene having different gels in the theater lighting, I suspect, also creates a split in color temp just above the midline."

That flame definitely added a bit of something special.  The colors seem realistic, and not overly saturated.  Nothing wrong with the light, although nothing particularly special about it either.  (Darn the morning not having been a nice pink sky morning huh?)"

The composition is really well balanced with spires to the left and right and the castle providing the perfect backdrop. Lines from the tracks and the background tableau lead nicely to the foreground subject. The tonal values are good (a bit dark in the shadows and a bit over-saturated for my taste).",

 "1127852.jpg": [
  "My first conscious thought upon looking at your image is to strip the processing away and simply evaluate the subject as it \"would have occurred\" in nature (ie. naturally). Having done that, I confront myself with a bee and a flower. Rather ubiquitous and commonplace, so no sense of enthusiasm or interest, really. Probably an image I would look at, give a 4 or 5, and move on without deeper consideration or evaluation."

Here we are compelled to consider the elegant, creamy, complicated structure of the swan's upraised wing and the abstracted curve of its slender neck.  They are lovingly set off by the pattern of the darker background water.  Just wonderful."

It would be more pleasing if someone was leaning out of one of the windows, or if curtains were blowing out a window, or some such thing.

 "1127475.jpg": [
  "Compositionally, I like the fill-the-frame idea for your shot. Your subject is shown off in all its glory, and yet there is enough of that beautiful, smooth background for me to enjoy that as well.  The bee really did not do much for me in this shot.  The flower is such a stunner, that I did not even notice the bee for the first few minutes looking at the image.  The bit of yellow in the flower kind of drowned out your sweet, but more muted, bee."

  "Problem number two is the big one for me - cannon direction.  The subject of a photo needs to have a way to interact with the rest of it, regardless of what it is.  Unfortunately, your cannon flows directly off the left edge.  Were it oriented even with the rotational issue, but facing left, it would improve this 100%.  Had you walked to the left and composed the image so the cannon sat on the right 1/3 line instead of the left, it would improve this 100%.  As is the entire image just points left."

Just my 2 cents worth...trying to be helpful."

  "Thank you for critique and feedback Mr.WBanning and also to you Penny for your feedback. This was a challenge that I just wanted to try and do well in and I lost myself a bit on the dice and their detail. I also agree that the tightness on the left bottom corner to me didn't let the subject \"breathe\" enough or \"expand it's wings\" with all the free space going on at the right side of the picture.",
  "What strikes me at first impression is the overall sharpness of the image and the care that was taken in its set-up. The high contrast B&W is effective and the pure white dice have retained detail in the highlights. There's even detail in the concave indentation of the pips on each die. The shiny paper is a nice addition and adds a bit of depth to the scene. The black dice are well exposed, too. Their background approaches the pure black of the background with the shape implied only by corners, edges, and shadows. Lots of excellent technical work here from my perspective - there's no question that this catches the eye on first glance. In addition to the first glance technical work, I like the care in placement and faces of the dice. The white dice showing a 7 from the top and an 11 from the side implies you may be a craps player. I'm less certain of the 8 sided dice's purpose in gaming, but did notice the care to show all 8 faces between the two black dice. Nice details."

  "First off, I'm always drawn to B&W images of flowers, as they can, at times surprisingly, depict the inherent beauty of a subject that typically uses color as a primary component of attraction, as this photo does. It presents a strong first impression. The dramatic contrast and abundant use of negative space really draws me in as a viewer. The off-center composition is effective as well and creates a powerful isolation of the subject - which is amplified by your choice of title. The patterns and contrast of the cut glass create a combined balance and tension for me. I like the mirroring of the flower with the radial pattern on the bottle directly below it, although, I'm struggling a bit with splitting my attention between the two - not really sure where to focus."

 "1123528.jpg": [
  "Lovely fellow.  :-)  Could have gone with a tad less negative space up top IMO.  The main subject here is the \"eyes\" and hairy-ness of the spider ... that is lost a little bit with the small area of the photo dedicated to it (i.e. a tighter crop may be better here?).  Also, the highlights are blown on the spiders back (that area is nearly the same size as the \"subject\" matter)."

  "There's a lot of debris across the roof and on the porch, but there's also a lot along the side of the house hidden in the shadows.  Softening the contrast might have helped you show a bit of that as well.  As I mentioned, there's also an overtly bright spot on the roof (bare alluminium?) that draws the eye immediately - but there's nothing there.  All this goes to say that there's no real subject here for the eye to be drawn to.  I suspect you mean it to be the house, and if so, show the whole thing.  Pull the shadows out on the side, burn in the roof a bit and get some evenness to the light.  Then burn in the area in front of the house and the highlights in the trees and make the whole thing pop."

The detail (wood grain, bushes, etc.) is also very nice. I think you did a good job with it. Happy shooting."

I do like it, just not as much as most folks did.  The spots are likely what kept me from being one of your 6's instead since these things to me always give the impression of being a little sloppy/lazy in post, and if there is one overriding thing in the photo that I'd want \"fixed\" it's that.  Otherwise, well done on a to 10."

As the composition rests now the flowers only appear in 30% of the composition and they are in competition with the large amount of negative space occupied with hearts. I think you do have a great idea it just needs better framing. I think that if you had just a few hearts (as well as less colors on the hearts) and had the orchids fill the frame more than it each would work to complement each other better."

Composition is excellent in that the main subject fills the frame and brings us in to appreciate the details. There is one thing that would greatly improve the shot and that is either different lighting and/or setting the camera's setting on vivid (if it has that function). The lighting (guessing it might have been taken in full shade) or mayhap the camera setting has the main colors of this flower a little on the dull and flat side. Looking at the thumbnail and at the larger picture as well it seems a little washed out when the colors should and could be more vivid. Making sure the lighting fully illuminates your subject not just to get good details but also (depending on subject and mood) make it visually pop is the one thing that would catapult this in the the high end of the scale."

  "Fantastic B&W tones and compositional crop bring me right to your main subject - the smiling girl with her cuddled cat. Very lovely girl and candid moment caught here. Lighting and details are spot on - a little blurred for the cat - maybe cat moved while shot was taken which a higher ISO will take care of and/or a higher aperature 7.1 or higher to get a greater DOF (although you may not get that nice bokeh background so it might just be a toss-up to what is best). None-the-less maybe a little blur is not so bad - life happens and movement gives this a feeling of being there at that moment to see and observe the beauty of the moment a girl cradling her beloved pet."

Not fond of the eye catching grasses leading from middle left into the picture nor the wood \"railing\" (?) or hand of man (man made object) in a \"Wildlife\" challenge. Wildlife photography avoids these things, and presents wildlife without it, even whilst it is becoming more difficult to find true wild in it's shrinking environment. Although the challenge description gives some leeway in this regard I am a purist. There is a difference between a nature image (non or captive animal in a man made environment) and a wildlife image even though your subject is wild and obviously not captive."

Compositionally I prefer the subject less centered, particularly in this case where the tiger is looking to the right - it makes the space to its left seem a bit redundant.  A tad over-exposed, as all detail seems to have been lost in the white on the left leg.  Focus and dof are spot on, wit the eye crisp, and also with a catch-light."

Everything else about this shot nears technical perfection and the emotional content transcends the commonality of such a prosaic location. One powerful ingredient: the low pov that gives the bike rider a wonderfully heroic stature. Others: the shadows, the beautifully captured atmospheric perspective, the bare trees, the distant cityscape - blend to give us the sense of the solitude and remoteness of the rider and his perseverance to keep going where he has to go. bump"

  "When I look at this photograph, I do still see the children of course, but much more indelible is the impression that I am primarily viewing not the children but the photograph itself as a thing, a cultural marker \uff03 and not looking at the photography.  Most people at DPC are, understandably enough, looking only at the photography of the subject.  The actual photograph is for them an ephemeral thing, a passing vehicle useful as a demonstration of their accomplishment: something to be copied if they like it, and copied again, and then discarded when they're done using it and ready to start copying something else.  Nothing necessarily wrong with that: they're nearly all people interested first in photography, and many of them are oblivious or unreceptive to a meaning of photographs outside of that personal context."

I think it's a white balance issue, leaving the snow gray rather than white because your camera's sensor is trying to find middle gray.  If that were corrected I think the snow would have been white and the orange part of the split pods would have popped (no pun intended) and given you a very high scoring image."

Not a technical thing, but it still hurts the photo is the stud in her lower lip... while I hate them as a general rule, it's a person thing for your model, but in this case, it looks like a fleck of something or food on her chin... IOW it's not distinctive enough as an adornment... something that would have been helped with a portrait oriented tighter crop."

If they are gone it just looks fake, and at least one here doesn't have shadows, which is disturbing to me. Apart from that it's a nice looking photo, but it lacks a little bit finesse to be ribbon material. A subtle vignette, or quite simply darkened the corners adds more depth to images, and is usually very pleasing to the eye. 5"
